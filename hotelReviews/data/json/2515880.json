Our first 50 points were at Saratoga Springs (beautiful resort!), we most recently purchased into Animal Kingdom Lodge and I couldn't be more happy after our first stay. We originally had 4 nights booked in a value studio which are on the \"smaller\" side, so we were told. When we got into our room, for two adults, the room was enormous! Even for a family with children the room would be great. We had a savanna view which I couldn't have been more happy about. The animals outside of the room were beautiful and very active all day and even in the evening. The room itself was so clean and spacious. Double sinks, separate room for the toilet and tub, kitchenette, pullout couch into a bed, everything was so great. The resort itself is BEAUITFUL! The landscaping is so well kept and everything was so clean. After our first 4 nights we extended our stay and had the standard studio room which is bigger than the value and the standard was HUGE. Big enough for 4 adults even! The pool was great. We ate at Bomas one night which was delicious! The Mara \"food court\" offers a lot of good options also. I can't wait to go back to this resort and my husband and I are SO HAPPY that we bought into this resort with our DVC!

We used Disney's Magical Express to transport us and our luggage from the Orlando airport to AKL. We arrived at approximately 11am, and knew there was the possibility our room would not be ready. As luck would have it, our room was ready for us, and, having used Disney's online check in service prior to arrival, our check in time on-site was limited to about 5 minutes. Our room was about halfway down the Kudu Trail, was on the 2nd floor, and overlooked the Sunset Savanna. We had reserved a \"standard view\" figuring we would not spend much time in the room, and were very pleasantly surprised that we received a complimentary upgrade to a savanna view. Our 4 year old was delighted that instead of 2 queen beds, there was 1 queen and 1 set of bunk beds. The rooms are somewhat small, and I have heard that's one of the reasons AKL is a little more modestly priced than other WDW deluxe hotels. Besides the queen and bunk beds, there was a mini-fridge, a TV stand with two drawers for clothes, a small round table with 2 chairs, a closet, and a night stand. The shower and commode are behind a door, and there is a double sink with a large mirror between the bathroom and the sleeping area. There is a wall between the double sinks and the beds; however, there is no door to serve as a light/sound barrier between the two. From other reviews, this has been one of the negatives about the room layout (meaning that someone getting ready at the sink could be disruptive to those in the sleeping area). We didn't have a problem with it - we wore our 4 year old out! During our stay, we saw the giraffes, zebras and ostrich numerous time. We also saw some of the hoof stock and ankole cattle from our balcony. Across the savanna we could see Kidani Village, a Disney Vacation Club property. It was far enough away that it didn't detract from the view. One night, from our balcony we could hear the live entertainment covering Beatles songs. The lobby of AKL is gorgeous, and people justifiably rave about it. Here are the negatives - and please keep in mind, I still rated AKL as excellent. AKL is BIG. We were about 1/2 way down Kudu trail, and it took us a good minute or two of walking to get back to the lobby, then up the stairs, through the lobby, out the door, and down the hill to the bus station. Overall, we probably had a 5 minute walk from room door to the bus waiting area. It doesn't sound like much, but after a long day at the parks, it feels like a mile. We were on the dining plan. AKL's dining options are somewhat limited. I understand some of the moderate Disney hotels have food courts. AKL has 1 signature table service restaurant (Jiko), one buffet (Boma), and one quick service restaurant (The Mara). All have African inspired dishes, and some traditional American fare. I really like Boma, and enjoy trying various cuisines. My wife's taste is a little more limited, and she felt like she ran out of less exotic menu choices pretty quickly. As part of the dining plan, we received mugs with unlimited refills at AKL. These included fountain drinks, coffee and tea. We only filled them once or twice a day. Kudu Trail is on the opposite side of the resort from The Mara where the drinks were located. It was a 4-5 minute walk each way (often longer with my 4 year in tow). Had it not been so far, we might have taken greater advantage of this perk. Our housekeeper was a little gruff with us at one point (even after tipping her $5 a day). We had just gotten back from the parks and were going to have some afternoon pool time when she initially knocked on the door (probably around 3:30). I asked for 5 mins and she seemed a little perturbed. Promptly at 5 minutes, she knocked again and seemed a little irritated that we weren't quite ready for her. I had one concierge member who was a little snooty to me about a dinner reservation -- all the others were amazingly helpful. AKL is in a fairly remote corner of WDW. The only transportation offered here is bus (no monorail, no boats). Bus to Animal Kingdom is 10 mins including a stop at Kidani Village. Bus to Downtown Disney is about 20 minutes. The beds are very firm. I suppose this could be a positive, depending on your preference. Random Note - Neither Positive nor Negative Immediately below our balcony was an enclosure with a stockade style fence. When I saw two of the animal keepers outside, I asked them what it was for. If there is an emergency, and people in their rooms cannot escape through the lobby, they evacuate the guests to this outdoor enclosure instead. The positives: It's a beautiful building. The architecture is amazing. The pool is great, kid-friendly and the waterslide is a lot of fun. there is a full service bar right next to the pool as well. And, there is a playground and hot tub in the same area as well. There is always an animal to see - even at night. Go to a viewing platform, and they will let you use night vision goggles and tell you where to look. Finally, the customer service was exemplary (outside of our couple of minor encounters noted above - however, I always want to acknowledge that some could just be having a bad day. My wife hurt her knee at one of the parks. We're not really sure how she did it (no memories of a bad twist, etc), but it became swollen and painful enough that we went to urgent care. The protocol for getting medical care at AKL is to dial 911 from your room (unless it's an absolutely emergent situation). We called, the dispatcher asked some basic medical questions, and only a few minutes later people began to arrive at our room. Eric (I hope I got his name right. You can't miss him - he played offensive line for Va Tech) was on the spot supervising the situation as the paramedics arrived and checked out my wife. They gave us contact information for a local urgent care facility, and left us with a wheelchair to use for the remainder of our stay. We ended up calling urgent care, who picked us up, checked her out, gave her some crutches and ibuprofen for her knee sprain and took us back to AKL. When we arrived at our room, we discovered that Eric and hotel management had room service deliver milk and cookies to us, along with a get well soon card. The cookies and card were on a tray on the bed, the milk was in the fridge. It was a very nice touch. I would stay at AKL again in a heartbeat. The negatives I mentioned above are nothing new - I have read the same items on several sites, but they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the positive aspects of this resort.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorst Disney hotel and experience I have ever had.\u201d", "Author": "TDowl", "ReviewID": "UR128547902", "Content": "I am writing this review while being swarmed by bugs while waiting for the Disneys Magical Express outside this hotel that is has never showed up an was supposed to be here 50 min ago. There are no employees here to explaon why it is not here or what is going on. Just the fifty bugs swarming around me and my bags. There are like eight of them hanging out out front of the hotel and in the valet area. None have come over. I went and asked them three times. None were helpful or could explain. Where it is or why it's not here or when another one will come. This is par for n the course for my stay at this hotel. A little backstory. I love Disney. I used to come here as a kid. Love coming here. I live in la and am an annual Passholder at Disneyland. And just upgraded to get a pass here at Disneyworld. I was at the Yacht club all week an loved it. I moved here because they didn't have availability and the diary person recommended it. Said it was a must see as I should try it. I hated it. The rooms are cheap. The bed uncomfortable. The spread is made up of a cheap uncomfortable material. I have now been out here for an hour. And tried to go talk to people five times. No one seems to care or be helpful or that we are all still waiting. The magical express is a great thing. It ideally makes things easy on you. You are supposed to not need to worry about your bags. Not today. Before ours never showed up... We r supposed to hear from them a day early about what time our pick up is. I never heard from them an had to call three people last night to find out when it was coming. The people at the hotel were no help with this. I asked magical express what I needed to do with my bags. They said call the hotel. I did again. I said I was gonna check in and pay my bag fee. They said yes do that and I can drop off my bag at the airline check in in the lobby. So I did this. Today after getting a late check out til 1. I was in te shower and at 1130 had someone banging on my door. Ran out in a towel asking what thy wanted and try informed me I was past checkout. I informed them through the door that I had a late check out. He grumbled and went away. So then I went to the lobby to check my bag so Isis t have to worry about it. After waiting in line I was told that oh no u checked in and paid for your bag already we can't take it. I informed them that is why Ty told me to do. They said we did not tell u that. I said the hotel did. They said sorry u need to take yor bag tithe airport now. Which defeats the convenience of the magical express. I ask to speak to a manager. And one comes and tells me oh well sorry we can't do anything. And I feel like you are Disney. You are supposed to have the best customer service around and when u tell me something wrong. You need to find a way to make up for it. Call the airline. Talk to someone. Figure it out. But it was nope sorry we screwed up. Not out problem u deal with it. Now that I had my bag. I felt I didn't need to leaveforthw airport three hours early so I called magical express and asked if I could take a later bus so I had mOre time in the park. They said no they couldn't change my bus. That I needed to pave that early and should show up 15 min before my time because they always run on time and won't be late. An hour later still waiting outside for my bus. I'd talk about he terrible food at the hotel and how it was cold and bad. But I am tired of typing. Horrible service. Horrible customer service. Really soured me on Disney and making a trip back here. No one offered any apology or anything in return. Maybe I will just go to Universal and Harry Potter next time. I am writing this on my phone in the hot sun while being swarmed by bugs. A I apologize for the typos and autocorrect.

We chose to stay in the main hotel at Jambo house rather than Kidani Village as we love the main lobby area and the bar there. Our room was a value studio, not sure why it was classed as value as it was a full sized DVC studio and we were overlooking the Savannah. We had giraffes, Zebra an Ostrich and other animals hanging around right infront of us. We spent hours just watching them - brilliant! The room was a typical Disney Vacation Club Studio and had everything that we needed. The Pool was lovely but really busy, would have liked a quiet pool to go to like they have at other resorts but this wasn't the case here. We ended up sitting by the Flamingo area which was a bit quieter but with easy access to the main pool. Didnt use the restaurant in the lodge as the buffet is heaving and the other restaurant a bit pricey but we LOVE the Sanaa restaurant over in Kidani village, its one of our favourite restaurants in Orlando, great if you like a bit of spice, you can walk to Kidani village in 10 mins or they have a bus. My only criticism is that like every other resort the buses take forever. AK lodge is a lond way from Downtown Disney and Magic Kingdom and even the closer resorts take forever.

We were pleased with the \"club floor\" extras since we could have breakfast there every morning before going to the parks. The pool looked nice and was quite large but we weren't there to swim. There are buses to each park but be aware that they get crowded at peak times and the ride to Magic Kingdom takes a while. One of the few negatives to the hotel is the quick service dining restaurant which I suppose is normal for Disney but I would prefer a place to get a better meal at lunchtime with table service or a less chaotic environment.

To stay at a hotel where the animals are right outside your bedroom window is truly spectacular, Sure, they put their food where you will get the best views, so it's a little \"staged\", but it is still wild zebras, giraffes, etc. The guides/advisors..... People directly from Africa, who are hired for a year or so, to come work at Disney and share their life, their knowledge and their passion for these wonderful animals. Grace in particular was wonderful and treated my wife and I like long lost friends. She is from Botswana, and when we go to Africa, we will try to visit her. She was that friendly! The hotel itself.. Beautifully decorated, with actual African artifacts. We were told it is the largest and most valuable collection outside of Africa itself. Wonderful, picturesque building. The food... Wow....Yummy with the perfect amount of exotic ingredients. Brought home many warm memories and recipe ideas. The Good: The hotel lobby bar. Nice location, decent servers, but tended to be pretty noisy around dinner until 10pm or so. Still a nice place for a drink and a snack. The OK: The actual rooms... Not anything special really. On the small side. But the views........ :-) What you need to know: People, you are on a Disney property. They don't do \"small\". Sure you walk a lot. Get over this \"issue\" and just walk. It's worth the effort. The building is setup in type of layout so everyone gets a chance to see the animals. Try the pool area at least once if it's not 100+ degrees. It is a very nice area and the hot-tubs are very secluded and nice. Eat at Boma for Breakfast at least once and try something outside your comfort zone. It's worth it!! Dinner is wonderful as well.

Just that in the interest of balance these were some points for improvement. 1. Unless you're paying the extra for a savannah room, it's rather pointless staying here. You can see the same animals on a trip to Animal Kingdom theme park. 2. Concierge were not at all helpful with booking the Magical Express to the airport when we were leaving. Twice I was fobbed off with instructions to merely tell the valet in the morning that we'd like to travel and that would be sufficient, despite having been told elsewhere to the contrary. Finally I asked one of the night staff at reception to look into it and within seconds our boarding passes had been printed. Thanks a lot concierge. I should stress though that this is the only unsatisfactory exchange with customer service staff for our entire stay. 3. Location. This is relatively speaking of course.

If you accept that is what you are getting then fine, go for it. We spent two weeks in Orlando at two different hotels. The first was the Waldorf Astoria (reviewed seperately) which was cheaper and better (but not good). When we arrived at Animal Kingdom we had a big booking problem (thank you to hotels.com for resolving for us) but that meant that we started in a room at Kidani and then ended up at Jambo House so we can comment on the comparability. In our view Kidani is a smaller poor relation (fewer facilities and the pool is too small) but otherwise a carbon copy. We eventually booked into a large 4th floor 1 room suite (these are all standard hotel rooms folks, none are \"villas\") with a lounge and kitchen area (beware that smaller rooms do not have a kitchen despite some of the apparent advertising). The large rooms are nicely done although for the price are a bit tacky. The comments about things being too dark are frankly just silly, the lighting is perfectly adequate. Service throughout was \"Disney Standard Service Level\" (DSSL = lots of smiles but largely slow and inneficient). Food is also \"Disney Standard Food\" (DSF = overpriced and largely poor quality).

We stayed in room 2232 and it was very comfortable for a family of four. My only complaint about the room is that the lighting in the bathroom is quite dim. Brighter lighting would definitely help make it easier to apply make-up! The hotel is quite large and we found it a little confusing getting from our room to the pool area at first. A few of the signs aren't very clear. (you enter the lobby which is actually the 3rd floor, but the pool is on the ground floor). But, the pool area is wonderful and features a little slide the kids just loved. There's a bar there, too, for parents and towels are provided for free.

We stayed in Jambo house which had a view over the savannah between it and Kidani. This area is huge and there is enough distance and trees so that you're not staring into other peoples room in the opposite building. The animals actually were called in for their checks between 7am & 9am but there were usualy wnough to make an early morning viewing worthwhile and they are around until late and it's great to sit on your balcony watching the animals as the sun goes down. Rooms aren't that big but well decorated and all in keeping with the African theme. Porters and cleaners are very good and well worth their tips. My only real quibble is with the restaurants - there seemed to be 3. One that was near the pool which was self service although when we went one evening there was a woman taking our order on a notepad before we went up with our tray to collect it - frankly she didn't seem to have a clue as to why she was there or what she was was doing but we got our food nonetheless. This was also where we got our breakfast ( although you can get it at the others) and it was perfectly serviceable although i would recommend having it at a table outside in the warm rather than the O.T.T. AC. The second hotel is called Bomu ( i think) and all the staff were recommending it. Frankly i think its massively over rated. we thankfully reserved a table as we saw from the previous night how busy it got. Basically it's one massive self service carvery and although you have a waiter they are there purely to bring you your drinks and clear away the dirty dishes you rapidly acquire as you return to the buffet. The food in fairness is very good and I ate so much I didn't eat for the next 18 hours. But it's incredibly busy and consequently noisy and is anything but relaxing after a long day at the animal kingdom itself. By far the better restaurant is the Waiter service restaurant opposite Bomu. It is more expensive but a lot, lot calmer. Dishes averaged about $38 per adult for main course and $10 for a dessert. There is also a good bar there ( although Disney hotel's don't serve beer stronger than $5 apparantly) and there are plenty of quiet little corners, balconies and alcoves to sit which is a very relaxing way to watch the day draw to a close. I really liked the building and was surprised at just how big it is - our room was about a third of the distance from the reception but it was still a bit of a trek to get to your room. It's definately worth staying in as long as you have a decent savannah room view. My only complaint about the room is it's safe which is completely inadequate as its only about 3 - 4 inches deep - anyhting wider than that you'll never get in.

Our room was excellent, clean and amazingly quiet, considering that parenting now seems to exclude keeping small children from running down hallways and yelling, no matter what time of night, but, alas the good people of Disney cannot control that. But what is in their control they do marvelously. The service is sincere and dedicated without being phony or ingratiating. These \"cast members\" are a delight and truly seem to enjoy what they are doing. I was admiring a piece of art in the lobby and a gentleman who I assume was on the custodial staff stopped to talk to me about the piece. He was so genuinely excited about it, I couldn't help but warming to the moment. And there were an abundance of activities from movies at the pool in the evening, to talks about the wild animals on the grounds. And that is perhaps the most spectacular aspect of this magical hotel: a wide variety of beautiful animals roaming freely on the property; zebras, ostrich, large horn African cattle. I can honestly say that it was worth the price of admission when on our first night as I lay down to fall asleep, I could literally look out of the window and see a sleeping giraffe. If you love nature and wild life, especially with the African theme, then spending the extra money for a room that views the grounds is extremely rewarding. I cannot imagine this experience anywhere outside of Africa. On a more traditional note, the pool and other facilities were top notch, as well. Returning from the various parks each day was made even more memorable by the wondrous environs of the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I have stayed at Disney before, but I should I return - and it is likely I will - I cannot envision staying at another property. Simply amazing. Thank you so much to each and every person at the Jambo house for making our stay so memorable. I cannot overstate how wonderful a spot this is.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sorrento", "Title": "\u201cThere are no words\u201d", "Author": "TrishN67", "ReviewID": "UR127802806", "Content": "This is, by far, the most beautiful place I have ever stayed.

I can not express how much we enjoyed our stay here. This is our third trip to Disney and we have moved up from the All Star Sports Resort and Wildnerness Campsite to the AKL. Although the listed check in time is 3:00 we arrived at 1:00 and our room was available and ready. The lobby is absolutely beautiful and we were quite amazed when we walked out into our balcony and observed the giraffes, zebras, ostriches, etc. Among the many benefits to staying on the property was the bus transportation, the \"Magic\" hours afforded to guests and the dining plan. The buses run frequently from the property to each park and we never waited longer than 20 minutes for a bus. The Mara is the fast casual dining option available with the dining plan and we ate breakfast here and a late night dinner. The breakfast options included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuit, potatoes and a Mickey Mouse shaped waffle. Other meals available include a bacon cheesburger, chicken nugget meal, pizza and salads. They also have drinks available, desserts, muffins, snacks and fruit. We also recieved a mug upon check in and you can use it throughout your stay from 6 am until 11:30 pm. The only regret about my stay was not eating at The Boma restaurant. I recommend that you make dining reservations as soon as you make your plans to visit WDW. We did enjoy a character breakfast at the Tusker House in Animal Kingdom with Donald Duck, Daisy, Mickey and Goofy. We also had a character dinner at The Crystal Palace in The Magic Kingdom with Pooh and friends. Tigger was a big hit with everyone.

The lobby is the most gorgeous I have ever seen. The detail is beyond words; pictures do not do it justice. It has so much more character to it than any other Disney hotel, and I am a huge fan of all of them. You just feel like you've been transported to another world as soon as you arrive. The theme carries through every aspect of the hotel; nothing has been overlooked. My room was very nice and extremely clean. The pool area is beautiful as well; the landscaping is so lush, the pool huge, and the bar has a lot to offer. The dining is my favorite of any hotel in Disney. Jiko is one of the best dinners I've ever had, and Boma was great for breakfast. And the savannas are gorgeous. There are so many animals, and if you do not have a savanna view room there are plenty of viewing areas to see them. The only reason I rated it four stars instead of five was because my room was extremely inconvenient to get to. Once in my room I hated to run out to do anything because it was over a five minute walk just to the lobby. The hall just went on and on. If the hotel had those nice boat rides to the parks like some of the Magic Kingdom and Epcot resorts I'd never stay anywhere else. A lot of people complained about the transportation to the parks, but I had no problem with it. If you want the ultimate convenience you have to stay at an Epcot or MK resort.

The restaurants served a fairly nice variety, though lacked in \"kid friendly\" cuisine. We stuck to the quick serve location whenever we ate at the hotel.

We loved the theme and had a savannah view room. There aren't many places in this part of the world where you can sit on your hotel balcony watching zebras, giraffes, ostriches etc. It was lovely! Location I was a little worried about the location after reading some of the reviews. AKL is a bit further out than some of the other hotels. However there were absolutely no problems with the location. The buses were very reliable and it didn't take too long to get anywhere. We never waited too long for a bus to arrive. There really is no need for a car if you are planning to stay within Disney World. Room Our room was lovely, beautifully decorated and a good size. Yes...as many of the reviews state, rooms are dimly lit as is the whole hotel. This is for the sake of the animals, and of course their safety and wellbeing is more important than perfect lighting! It's not as if you can't see where you are going...it just isn't bright. My only complaint about the room is that I feel that in a hotel of this standard a dressing gown and a pair of slippers should be provided for each guest. I was surprised that there were none. However, we stayed at the Hard Rock at universal after leaving AKL and it was the same story there. Perhaps this is just the norm in the local area. Dining I have written a review about most of the restaurants so if you are interested you can have a look. To summarise I found Jiko and Sanna pleasant but a bit average. Boma provided a really nice breakfast buffet. The Mara is handy for drinks if you are hanging out by the pool. But the food? Don't bother. Very unpleasant fast food...complete rubbish! Front Desk/ Concierge service This was a hit or a miss. When we checked in the guy was very friendly and helpful, but also asked for things like phone numbers and email addresses. We had already given this info when we booked and just wanted to get to bed after flying 9 hours across the atlantic. Also, no help was provided when we were getting our luggage from the bus into the hotel for check in. At a hotel of this standard somebody should help you with your bags. A few days in I went to the concierge desk as I had a few questions. The woman I spoke to was unhelpful and extremely rude. She made it very clear that she had no interest in answering my questions, and I left feeling almost as clueless as I had before I spoke to her. To some of my questions she simply answered \"I don't know\" and she even shrugged on a few occasions. I asked which of the hotel restaurants was the best for vegetarian food. She shrugged and told me \"you'll have to call in advance and and ask for a meal to be prepared because there are no vegetarian options at any of the restaurants.\" Later I discovered that not only did every restaurant have veggie options...Jiko had an entire veggie/vegan menu!!!! Not impressed. A few days later we went to front desk as there was an issue with a gift voucher which would not work. This turned out to be the fault of Disney UK, but the staff were very kind and helpful, and ended up crediting money to our account although it was not their fault. This great service helped make up for the concierge incident! When we left there was once again no help with luggage and and no help getting a taxi. We were ignored by the large number of staff standing outside the entrance, who are responsible for organising taxis, buses, cars etc. It will seem that this review is a bit of a moan!! Don't get me wrong...our experience at AKL was very good! But there were just too many little imperfections, and service was not always up to Disney standards. I'm not sure if I would stay here again, simply because there are so many Disney hotels waiting to be tried out!!

There are other nice areas to hang around including indoor and outdoor \"fire pits\" where you can warm up on a chilly night. The room however, was very small and very average in it's furnishings.

It wasn't as crowded as earlier reviews have indicated, although there didn't seem to be anything stopping non-guests from hanging out there. The front desk staff assured us that only guests could get in, but I'm not sure exactly how that was supposed to work, given that the gates didn't require you to use a card to get in. We did try to bypass the regular bus one morning (they were super packed, since the whole state of TX has the same Spring Break) by grabbing a cab one morning. REALLY BAD IDEA! They don't drop you off in front of the park (Magic Kingdom) - they drop you off at the monorail/ferry center, where you have to wait forever to get on one or the other.

We were also fortunate to have got a free dining plan for the week for 9 of us from Virgin Holidays. That was a huge saving. The staff were all superb.

The attendant knew somehow that it was our anniversary and also had the pronunciation to our name correct (our name, while common sounding, has an unusual spelling). Upon arrival at the gorgeous, African inspired resort we were met by a very friendly lady who showed us to the express check-in line. We were able to get our room early and enjoyed the kids playground and viewing the pink flamingos while we waited. We also enjoyed lunch at the Mara- they have great flatbread pizzas. Our room, while pretty and colourful, was a bit small with the two queen beds. The bathroom area was nice, as was the balcony, but the actual living space was the only disappointment of the whole hotel. Disney's Animal Kingdom lodge was a wonderful hotel. The service was excellent, the hotel is very clean and beautifully maintained and the added elements of having a safari like mini zoo surrounding it was really special. It is neat to see a giraffe as you are walking from your room to the pool through one of the many large windows. The restaurants at Animal Kingdom Lodge - Jambo house are really nice and we walked up to the other part of the resort - Kidani Village for dinner at Saana - and it was the best meal we had the whole time at Disney - dinner while looking at Zebras 20 feet from your table - a magical evening for sure. The pool and gift shop are great as well and kids can watch movies at night beside or in the pool. They have two great hot tubs too to enjoy. Tips - subscribe to the insiders Disney newsletter a few months before you are hoping to book a Disney trip at - www.mousesavers.com - this site sends you insider tips about 1x a month and i learned through one of the newsletters that Disney had a 'free meal plan' promotion. This saved us about $800 in meals and we ate like Kings for the whole time we were there with only paying for a couple of breakfasts. Another tip is to use the disney.com Mom's panel advice - great advice when booking Disney hotels. You can also make dinner reservations for any Disney restaurant on the Disney website - much more convenient than by phone and do this as early as you can to avoid disappointment. Also i recommend taking the Disney bus transport rather than your rental car if you have one. We took our car the first day and it was more of a hassle than the Disney bus system which runs very smoothly. It is not far from this hotel to any of the Disney parks.

What is a once in a lifetime vacation for many families for me has become the consistent weekend getaway. What amazes me most about Disney is its ability to be amazingly fresh and unique. This was the case in my first stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL) this past weekend. A bit more secluded than other resorts on property, the AKL is tucked away adjacent to Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park. The resort is broken out into two sections; Jambo House and Kidani Village. Jambo House is the original center of the resort with Kidani Village recently opening as a home base for Disney Vacation Club members. I was fortunate to have a savannah view room in the Jambo House on the second floor. The Jambo House will serve as the basis for this review. As expected with Disney, the detailed theming is evident from the moment one walks in. The Jambo House appears to be a large \"hut\" with straw roofing and tree bark walls. The lobby was overwhelmingly beautiful with displays of authentic African artistry and lavish theming. The backside of the lobby is a large open window with outstanding view into the savannah. This is where Disney hits it out of the park. Where else can you stay in this region where you can walk outside and see beautiful African animals roaming around this beautiful landscape? Check in service was fantastic as is the norm with Disney. The person checking me in was a new employee with a tag labeled \"earning my ears\" which I thought was cute. Upon receiving my check information I made the long hall to my room (placed in the last section of the building). Yes this could be a long walk so if you would like to avoid don't hesitate to request a room closer to the lobby. One thing I have learned with Disney resorts is that luxury is not the key. While their rooms are not designed as five star rooms, they do offer small touches with theming and distinction that brings out their uniqueness. We had a room overlooking the savanah and were fortunate to see an abundance of animals from the balcony. Again, you won't get this kind of experience outside of Disney. The amenities at AKL were really a standout point. The pool was of really nice size complete with a slide which all the kiddies seemed to enjoy. A hot tub was located adjacent to pool partially secluded under several trees. I have to say on a chilly evening, this was the ticket. The fitness area blew me away with plenty of machines and free weights. I'm not one for working out during a getaway but having the option is always a plus. AKL is home to two popular Disney restaurants; Boma and Jiko. Boma is the buffet-type restaurant open for breakfast and dinner. Boma is more on the casual side but definitely a unique experience. Jiko is the higher grade restaurant with a more intimate atmosphere. If you are feeling really adventurous, hop over to the Kidani Village for Sanaa, an african themed full service restaurant. For those that are looking for quick dining, don't fret as a food court called Mara is available adjacent to the pool area. Here you can grab a quick burger, pizza, or other snacks. There are no bigger perks to staying on Disney property than extra magic hours at the theme parks and free transportation. Although AKL has a relatively remote location within Disney borders, their bus service is one of the better I have experienced. The resort only has two stops (one for Jambo and other for Kidani) and is really not a very long bus ride to the other theme parks. Remember though that wait times are a very variable issue and anything can either prolong or expedite your transportation around the resort. Number of guests, traffic issues, & luck all have impacts on wait times for transportation. AKL is part of Disney's deluxe resort category. Understand that the emphasis here is not on overall luxury but uniqueness of experience. Sometimes because of the pricing we are expecting to be staying in the Waldorf Astoria. Two different experiences!!! Think about this when staying at Disney; what is the driver behind the cost? What you get at a place like AKL is something you won't get elsewhere. It is a family experience that will stick out from other hotel stays and at the end of the day, we all want distinction. Hotel stays will vary based on the necessity of your trip. If you decide to stay in AKL, take some time to enjoy this unique experience. A day off from the parks at this place will really make that expense worth the price.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cAfrican Themed Luxury\u201d", "Author": "rikrax", "ReviewID": "UR124659387", "Content": "We spent a week at the Animal Kingdom Lodge in February.

Very nice resort and great amenities. Great to have a room with a view to see the animals. View / no view depends what you are looking for when choosing a resort and how much time you anticipate spending in your room. Many places to sit and view the animals all over the hotel. Yes the hallways are dark, but that goes with the theme and really not sure why people are complaining about this. Do agree however that the walk can be very long if you are towards the end away from the lobby. If you have mobility issues I would recommend advising the staff when you book as this long walk would be difficult for some people. Pool excellent.

Nice activities for the kids throughout the day. Staff were really good with the kids. Parade in the evening was a big hit. Staff in general- the ones that were good were REALLY GOOD but the others for the most part were very indifferent the concierge being the most unhelpful considering that was her job.

Although you do have to take a bus to get to any parks, the resort makes up for all of that. Our most recent stay at this resort was in January of 2012 for Disney's Marathon weekend. The decor in the Lodge is warm and welcoming. The lobby is vast with huge windows in the back overlooking the savannah. The colors are mostly browns, tans, and oranges - very muted. The lighting isn't very bright in the hallways but fits in with the overall feeling. In the lobby you there is a fireplace and down one level to the right you will find the Victoria Falls Lounge. There is an indoor waterfalls to fit the entire theme of this lounge. Go down one more level and you will find two very popular eating places Jiko (The Cooking Place - a more formal place to enjoy dinner) and Boma (an informal buffet open for breakfast and dinner) You can exit the lobby and go outside to a welcoming firepit complete with rocking chairs and many viewing areas to enjoy the animals out on the savannah. You will usually find a cast member by the animals who knows quite a bit about the animals and their habits. Take the time to talk to one of these staff members. Many of them are from Africa and have some interesting stories to share. Our room was on the Disney Vacation Club Level and we had a studio suite which consisted of one Queen bed and a pull out sofa. Only my husband and myself were on this trip so the room was just the right size. The double sinks have their own section apart from the toilet and bathtub/shower. We also had a small area with a fridge, microwave, and toaster. Our room had a view of the savannah. During the colder times, you will not always see a lot of animals out and about. This is especially true in the early colder mornings. We did not spot one animal any morning of our stay but we were always up pretty early and it was still cold outside by Florida standards. Our room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. There was a small balcony outside of our room with two chairs where we were able to view some animals during the warmer afternoon hours when they were out and about. By the pool, you will find Mara - a quick service place to eat. There is also a bar by the pool. The excersise room is state-of-the art. Seriously good for a hotel - like a small well stocked gym and kept very clean. Even if you don't have a room with a savannah view, you can still enjoy the animals as there are many public viewing areas along each of the floors for guests to use. Each time we stay in this resort, we feel relaxed and transported to something out-of-the-ordinary. If you are traveling with children be sure to ask about some of the special programs they hold throughout the day.

First, let me mention that we are Florida Residents and Annual Passholders, so we did get a discounted rate for the hotel (especially it being value season!). We originally requested a king bed, savanna view on the 2nd floor. Check-in was fine, however they couldn't get us a king or a 2nd floor room, but said it would be available the next day. First night we were on the 4th floor in a savanna room (directly across Kidani Village's Sanaa restaurant. My wife saw some animals and thought it was great. The next day we were transfered to a Arusha Savanna view on the 2nd floor by Zebra's Trail (king bed)! THIS VIEW WAS AMAZING! My wife loved the animals and the animal keeper saw her out on the balcony and put the lettuce in the trees right by our window so she could have a closer view of the giraffes. Very nice. Rooms are pretty normal hotel rooms, nothing fantasy or 'Disney' about it, but they are clean. The hotel itself is very clean, you won't smell the animals. The lobby in beautiful, however I feel it was missing the 'Disney' touch. Where is Mickey in Safari gear or any character paintings? The only Mickey and Disney items are in the hotel shop. Staff was very friendly, my wife just discovered pin trading and she annoyed everyone there, but they did it with a smile lol. The property is beautiful and you can see the animals on countless places (they have observation decks with binoculars and even night vision goggles at night). Some restaurants also have a view of the Savanna. Boma was great for BREAKFAST as it's a buffet and was responsibly priced. We had the dinner buffet there once, it was pretty good, but nothing to repeat. We had breakfast 5 out of the 7 days at Boma though. Breakfast would be fine for children, but the dinner was lacking in the kid's food department. We tried Sanaa the first night, the food wasn't bad at all, but it's not our thing (very African/Indian type style), so we didn't enjoy it too much. Also it was packed so it took us a while to get served. The menu is decently sized but if your not adventurous in your food, then you might want to pass. They apparently do accommodate children as I saw a few eating a pizza, however if we had kids I don't think we would take them there. It's not too kid friendly. We passed on Jiko because of the menu, as the only thing we would really have wanted was the Filet Mignon which was $43. The Mara is there quick service downstairs, we ate there for lunch a few times and to get snacks. It's easily the best place to eat if you have kids, they have burgers, sandwiches, pizza, milks, cereal, salads, etc. The food was very very good. If you buy the souvenir cup, you can have free refills at the restaurant the entire trip. NOTE: Room Service is only until midnight and the Mara closes at 11:30, during that 30 minute time, the R.S. menu is very limited. Don't bother unless you want a special desert or shrimp, I ordered a burger the first night and then the next night I went to the Mara. Same burger, $7 more if you order through Room Service. SO make the walk if you can. The pool is nice and we went in once, but it was way too cold. The hot tub is nice as well. As for the bus system, we went during a time that wasn't really busy, but the longest ride took maybe 20 minutes? We didn't mind it at all. We used the buses the entire trip. My parents and my two younger sisters (13 and 15) came by to see the room and the animals; the animals were a huge hit! They loved it. We are actually planning on saying at Kidani Village later this year! Overall this is a wonderful property. I liked it, my wife LOVED it. Seeing the animals outside your balcony is very cool, but I prefer the whole Disney experience, which I thought was lacking some in the hotel.

This is my second review so I will try to keep it a little shorter and you can see my review history if you are interested in the original. Several people marked it as helpful. The resort itself it stunning. The lobby, restaurants, hallways - all breathtaking in their design. The amount of handcarved woodwork is astonishing. It really became much more amazing this time around as we spent more time at the resort and I really had a chance to appreciate it this time around. There are folks that complain about the rooms and say this isn't a 5 start resort, but I beg to differ. I too, travel. This is nothing like a typical 5 star resort like a Ritz or a Penninsula, etc. It doesn't have shiny modern design and finishings. This is a themed resort. A Safari theme - and if you really take the time to look around and appreciate all of it - particularly the architecture, finishes and lush grounds around the pool, you will see why it truly is 5 star. The rooms themselves may not seem 5 star. I mean, some have bunkbeds for heavens sake - but still, they are very nice. My take on this is that EVERY room in Disney is comparable from a value - deluxe. It is the resort itself that makes a room value, mod., deluxe. Advice - If this is your first trip, and money is at all a consideration. Go ahead and stay at a value resort and please don't feel you are missing out. A first visit to Disney is OVERWHELMING. There is so much to see or do, you could never do it all in a week, and you will find yourself leaving early and coming back late every day. We did this even with small children, taking advantage of the family/child centers available at each park to take breaks, change diapers, do feedings, etc. You won't even have a chance to appreciate the resort and depending upon the package and the number of people in your party, a value package could be nearly half the price. This was our third trip and we finally were able to spend more time at the resort and really did appreciate it and use the amenities, making it worth it. Savannah versus Standard. Both times we have stayed here we booked standards and were upgraded to Savannah. I think this has to do with arriving on Tuesdays. Most people arrive on a Saturday. There are likely way more people that book standard than they actually have rooms for. By the time Tuesday arrives I'm guessing those rooms are filled and that is why we have received the upgrade. Yeah for us. Take that information for what it is worth. The Mara - Am I crzazy or has the menu VASTLY improved here? Honestly, we ditched some of our sit down meals on the dining plan and ate here a few times instead. The food is amazing and there is a TON of it as they throw in desert. Don't miss it. Boma is also amazing. LOVED their breakfast AND Dinner. Save money with the dining plan: Yes, it is already paid for (or free, depending on the package you booked), but you will still pay tip - and this adds up. Tip at breakfast is much less than it is for dinner. On several days we used our sit down meal for breakfast which honestly kept us full until mid-late afternoon. Used a snack credit at the park (sometimes) and did a quick service at night back at the hotel or at the park. Something to consider, especially if you don't have advance reservations for sit down dinners which may or may not be hard to get into without them. Back to AKL. We saw lovely animals outside the room every day, it was incredibly clean, the bathroom was tiny but the shower was great. The rooms are nice and beautifully decorated but there isn't much dresser space - 2 drawers and a smaller nightstand drawer, bus service was great (It was January, however), the distance from Magic Kingdom wasn't a bother, the pool is phenomenal as are the grounds surrounding it, they do fun things like art and craft projects for the kids/families during the day, roast marshmallows by the fire pit near the pool, have night vision goggles to view the animals at night - it was fantastic. Again, it IS expensive. If money isn't an issue go and ENJOY! If you are watching your dollars go and enjoy one of their lovely value or moderate resorts, your vacation will be magical.

They still have plenty favorites for picky kid eaters. Pool was awesome, as was the playground that's a little \"hidden\" behind the pool area. Make sure to take advantage of the animal learning programs for kids. We missed one where kids could feed the flamingos (acutally everyone did....the \"teacher\" said no one showed up); Staff could have done a better job of making guests aware. Of course the parks were great as always, Animal Kingdom, MK, Epcot, MGM, can't go wrong!", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Issaquah, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Lodge, Great Food\u201d", "Author": "RainSeattleMom", "ReviewID": "UR124041531", "Content": "Things I loved: decor, animals (I did not get tired of them ever), simba club for kids so parents could eat alone at night, bunkbead, animal view from balcony, comfortable beds and pillows, hot water, pool w/lifeguards until 7p, and restaurants.

We had a 1 bedroom suite on the concierge floor. Everything about this hotel was great. The 1 bedroom suite consists of a separate bedroom with king bed that was very comfortable. There was a very spacious bathroom, with the shower and toilet in a separate room from the vanity. Our sons slept in the livingroom on a queen sleeper and sleeper chair. They are both approx 6'3\" and they fit on the sleepers fine. They also said that they were quite comfortable. We had a very nice full size dining table and full kitchen. Since we stayed on the concierge floor, we did not use the kitchen at all. This was our first visit to Disneyworld and now we are spoiled and would not want to stay anyplace else. The concierge floor was wonderful. My husband and I would go get coffee early and bring it back to the room to watch the weather for that day and read the free USA Today that was left outside our room each morning. We would get around, then go have a nice breakfast and head out to one of the parks. All four of us would meet for a nice lunch at a different park each day. That was the only meal we needed to purchase. When we got tired, we would head back to our room for a nap, stopping by the concierge for a few snacks and/or drinks. We would have an early dinner with the appetizers on the concierge floor. My husband and I would grab a plate, they always had bottles of wine, too. Then we would take them to our room and sit on our really nice balcony and watch the animals come by. We had a partial view savannah room, but we saw many different animals each day, there was no complaint. We would then head back to the parks or swim at the hotel. The pool, water slide and hot tub were all great. One night we went out to see the animals on the savannah with night vision googles and they also had a bonfire each night where they would roast marshmallows if you wanted. Housekeeping was great, never had a complaint. The room was always very clean and they would leave more than enough clean towels for the 4 of us. We splurged and did the Wanyama Sunset Safari and this was the highlight of our vacation for all four of us. We have wonderful memories of our stay here and had a fabulous family vacation.

And of course you can't miss the safari that's right on the property. The rooms are very clean and at least the room I stayed in with bunk beds had a fridge, flat screen tv and bluray player. Our room was on first floor facing the end of the pool area which meant almost no noise except for minor bubble sound from jacuzzi. It was a great little view. I will choose first floor in this area everytime since its close to pool and restaurants. The best thing of staying at Disney is the free transportation to all Disney areas. The pool was awesome. It was big pool with a slide. There is pool bar and 2 jacuzzis. There are plenty of activities for children and adults. Too many to name. 1 for adults and children is night vision goggles at night to view animals on some nights. During the day the giraffes and other animals are easy to see and get real close sometimes. There are also kids activities like face painting and cookie decorating. Overall I love this resort. We almost didn't go that many times to the park since resort has so much. The hallways are quiet and staff is friendly and very helpful. I recommend January best time to visit due to park being empty after holidays and Disney offers discounts if booked in advanced. Up to 45% off sometimes.

The good, as always with Disney, was the service of staff that we interacted with, the theming, and the food. Certainly no complaints there. Though the AKL is a wonderful experience, it did feel quite removed from everything else and took some time getting around. We had expected this and planned for it so it did not hinder our plans. However, now that we have stayed there once (and didn't spend nearly as much time as we thought we would watching the animals) we'll probably opt for a deluxe resort with larger rooms next time around. Overall the entire vacation hit the mark with our high Disney expectations. The few things I will mention are just nit-picky little things that kept me from giving it a \"5\" but certainly did not dampen our overall vacation in any way. My husband and I with the kids had a bunk bed room adjoining with the grandparents in a double queen. Overall the space felt tight. What stood out most as a contributing factor here was that there were only 2 drawers to unload suitcases into for our stay. It has been a few years since I stayed at the Polynesian but I seem to recall there being more individual drawer space. I could be wrong though. Everything in the room was clean and well presented. The kids were a bit disappointed though that for all of the photos of \"towel art\" online associated with this resort, we only had a flat round \"Mickey\" on arrival and nothing else for the 7 nights we were there. Regarding the value of this resort, you certainly pay a premium for the theming and it was our choice to do so, and our choice to book rooms that we knew would be pool not Savannah view. I was disappointed however, that in one of the slowest weeks of the season, having booked directly through Disney, our room were on the first floor and the only view we had was of large plants and peeks of pool water. Even one floor up we could have stretched our necks a bit on the balcony to see something, even a non-savannah bird flying by. Another time I would specifically request a higher floor, but then again, another time I would pick a resort that is more central on the property too. Our 9-year-old animal lover went nuts over the close proximity of the roaming wildlife (we basically picked the resort with him in mind) but after checking out all of the viewing areas on day 1 even he had no interest in wandering around again to see what was out and about.

We were initially given room 2241, which didn't thrill me. It was on the first level and I found it to be a little confining with respect to the view. Go higher if you can; the view will be opened up. Room 3309 was far better ... nice panorama of the Arusha Savanna and the nesting pelicans on the Arusha Rock Overlook. Lots of critters, day and night ... more on that a bit later. Room 3309: Two queen beds. African inspired decor featuring an abundance of thoughtful and attractive details; this was an pleasant hotel room. However, it was definitely on the small side (especially for the inflated price). More than two bodies would be uncomfortably crowded. The bathroom was tiny. If you're already ... uh ... \"sitting down,\" and more than small/average sized, it might be a challenge to close the door! But on the bright side, there's a separate area featuring double sinks and a convevient shelf than runs the entire length of the mirror. More good stuff: Decent \"minibar\" sized fridge. Cuisinart coffee maker with ample supply of individual coffee packs. And much to my surprise, that Arabican coffee was pretty good. Despite the cooler evening temps, I enjoyed sipping on a cuppa while admiring the animals from my \"private balcony seating.\" About the animals ... you'll find an illustrated \"Wildlife Field Guide\" list in your room. Believe me; you'll see most of the animals listed, and it's beyond thrilling. Your critter sightings are guaranteed, because food is stategically placed throughout the savanna as well as close to the rooms. What you won't see is any visible evidence that the zebra or ankole cattle or roan antelope passed directly beneath your balcony. The Disney poop patrol is ever vigilant! Bottom line, perhaps the whole experience is somewhat \"staged,\" but who cares? It still works! Some valuable tips: Chat with the uniformed African Cultural Exchange students that you'll find out on the Arusha Rock Overlook. They know everything about the animals and are happy to educate you about their home countries. After dinner, take a comfy seat by the Arusha Rock Fire Pit. You never know who you'll meet! Talking about hotel dining, give the Boma buffet a miss ... it was really disappointing. Noisy, ridiculously overpriced at $32.99 pp, average quality offerings, and a big zero for ambience. Take the Lodge van over to the adjacent Kidani Village. The Sanaa restaurant was a brilliant dining experience, and much, much better priced! The Mara \"cafeteria-style\" dining option was just fine for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the chicken tikka pita! While you're there, grab a carton of milk (for morning coffee) and a muffin or croissant as well. That way, you can enjoy a relaxed \"fuel up\" in the morning, while you're getting ready for the theme parks. Not to mention ... more time to admire the animals. So, bottom line, is a stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge worth the inflated price? For us, for this special occasion, I'd have to say yes.

Instead, I rent from DVC members. AKL is usually available closer to your stay and doesn't run nearly as much as other DVC resorts. I've booked with my agent for nearly half of what it would have cost me to stay at the Wilderness Lodge during the same time. Now the review! The pool area is nice, nothing extraordinary, but movie night at the pool is great if you have kids or you're just a kid at heart. Still, it's a large pool and the view of the Lodge from the Pool (especially at night) is outstanding. The food - Amazing! My wife and I have done Jiko and Boma, loved both. We tried the little cafe (Mara) and didn't care much for it, but that was sort of expected. Rooms - Well themed without being \"cartoonish.\" Our last stay (this was our 3rd) was with a pool view and it was amazingly quiet. The small balcony was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. We stay in Studios and they offer plenty of space. The Service - Always top-shelf!!! Like I said, this was my 3rd stay at AKL and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful. Not one complaint yet. The location - If you don't realize that you're quite a distance from the other resorts/parks, this may be an issue. Due to the distance (except from AK), you may end up waiting a bit for a bus and the ride is a bit longer. Our longest wait was about 30-40 minutes, but later that evening they fixed the problem by having a staffer on hand to make certain that extra buses were made available. Usual wait time for a bus was about 10-15 minutes max. The Resort - From the inside it is very similar to the grandure of the Wilderness Lodge. The lobby is very open and nearly everything is larger than life. The Savannah opens up through the large glass wall at the end of the lobby. This is great place to send the kids during check-in and it's worth a few minutes every day to just walk out and see the animals. If you like being close to the action, Jambo house is your best best. Jiko and Boma are both house in Jambo house and this is the classic lodge/resort. The other building was built for DVC and doesn't offer the restaurant choices or the same feel.

We ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner. I prefeferred the quick service for breakfast (the crossants were amazing). The buffet dinner was great. Its busy and crowded but it only takes a simple call a few hours before to reserve a table. The longest walk in wait was about 25 minutes. I enjoyed trying some ethnic foods. For dessert, the zebra domes are the absolute best thing I have ever tasted (I lost count after 30 or so...hehe) The pools and hot tubs were open 24 hrs and very clean. We rented scooters (ECV) which I would highly recommend for $20 a day (they are $60 in the parks) from Buena Vista Rentals, especially to get to the lobby for morning coffee. That was the only downside to this property. We were across the savanna from the lobby and its quite a hike. The staffs' nametags say where they are from and I really enjoyed talking to the native people from all over Africa, some of their stories are captivating. The beds were super comfy! We were in the 1bd suite with a king bed and the furnishings were beautiful. The sleeper sofa and chair was very easy to pull out and put back. Kidani is smaller then Jambo but the bus picks up and drops off at Kidani first and if you drive or rent a car, Kidani has way better parking. I would say if you are just looking for a place to lay your head, its a little pricey, but if you take the time to relax, explore, and see all this lodge has to offer, its well worth the money.

The food at Saana was SPECTACULAR. The drums during a birthday celebration were a little bit bothersome, but part of that was probably the fact that we were all so tired from spending the evening in the Universal Park, which was pretty crowded and overwhelming. We had the breakfast buffet downstairs, and it was wonderful. They had a really great turkey and vegetable fritatta and all manner of breakfast foods you may want. The rooms themselves were lovely.

I have attached some pictures to this review as well. Our room was at the Jambo House of the Animal Kingdom Lodge (as opposed to the Kidani Village of Animal Kingdom Lodge). We made the reservation through AAA back in July 2011. Our room was on the 3rd floor with a bunk bed, 1 queen bed, Savannah view with balcony to view the animals. Initially, we were placed into a room without a bunk bed and had not been made up yet, but we went back to the front desk and got the room we originally booked. We frequented the Mara food place because you could get food to go up until 11:30pm at night. My wife and I are vegetarians so we ordered the flatbread veggie pizza and falafel pita several times. One night we had dinner at the Jiko restaurant which was our fanciest, most expensive meal during our stay. We got hooked on the Jam Jar Sweet Syrah wine with which we had with dinner. Great service at this restaurant and caters to kids as well. The pool at the Jambo House of Animal Kingdom Lodge is large and heated at 82 degrees (I asked the front desk). There are 2 Jacuzzis near the large pool which was great for me and my wife to relax our sore muscles after marching through theme parks each day. The pool hours are 7:00am to midnight each day, however, the waterslide is open from 10:00am to 7:00pm. There were 3 lifeguards on watch when the waterslide was open. I recommend spending the extra money and getting a balcony with a view of the animals. I couldn't imagine having a view of the pool or something else. We rented a car and self parking was free and valet parking was available. The hotel is a Disney resort so there are buses which can take you to any of the theme parks at no extra cost. There were a couple days when we drove our car to theme parks and utilized the AAA \"diamond\" parking spots available at the theme parks. These AAA diamond parking spots fill up early in the mornings. Checking out of our room was easy. We had a credit card on file and went straight to the airport with our rental car. We had difficulties doing an online for check-in for our airline 24 hours before our flight. Supposedly a printer was down and we couldn't use the kiosk/computer. So we ended up using a computer inside the front desk employee offices to print out our boarding passes. Animal Kingdom Lodge needs to put in a business service area with several computers and printers so their guests can print out airline boarding passes.

We had a Savanna view, overlooking the Uzima Savanna. It was absolutely incredible. To be honest, I was skeptical at first on whether we'd even see decent animals, but within a few minutes of walking into our room, we went out on the balcony and saw giraffes, zebras, African cranes, wildebeests and numerous other animals! Throughout our entire stay, there was ALWAYS some type of creature viewable from our balcony. It was absolutely stunning and fascinating! We also really enjoyed that you could go out on Arusha Rock, outside the main lobby, and speak to one of the cast members out there who were happy to provide you with information on the animals, and answer any questions you may have about them. As always at Disney, the customer service was superb. I have always found that no matter where you are at Disney, the cast members are extremely friendly, helpful and professional. This was no exception. The main lobby is simply stunning. It's quite cavernous and when you first walk in your jaw drops just from the sheer size of it. There's plenty of seating, including some by the fire pit where one day we saw some people warming their feet! LOL! The gift shop, off of the main lobby, is excellent, and I bought quite a few items in there. Our room was very nicely appointed, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious (two sinks, yay!) and nice. No complaints there. The bus service worked very well for us. The stop was right off of the main lobby. We went during Christmas so we expected it to be busy, but we never had to wait more than 5 or so minutes for a bus and only once did we have to stand during the bus ride. We never moved our car for the entire weekend. We went to two of the restaurants: The Mara, where we ate breakfast every day and lunch one day, and Boma, the buffet. The Mara is nothing special: it's a quick service restaurant where you can get a quick bite. The breakfast was simple but perfect for us. They had eggs, bacon, waffles, the usual. The lunch was a bit questionable. The hamburger we ate one day wasn't very appetizing, but honestly, that day we were so tired that we didn't have the energy to venture out for something else. As for Boma, it was delicious! I am a BIG buffet fan, and this was nice. There were some African themed dishes, but nothing too strange and of course there were items like salad and macaroni and cheese for the less adventurous eaters. ;) We also had a drink up at the Victoria Falls lounge, which was lovely. A word on the prices: obviously, in that this is Disney, everything is overpriced. I think you have to recognize that going in. It's not going to be cheap, they hike up the prices for everything. I think you just have to realize that and deal with it as best you can. It's the price you pay (literally!) for staying on Disney property. It is what it is. The only real complaints I had are very minor and definitely could be overlooked. First, the distance between the lobby and our room was incredible. It was a long walk to the elevator, and then another long walk from the elevator to our room. It's simply how the hotel is designed (obviously because of the savannas), but it did get to be a bit inconvenient at times, especially once when we were in a hurry and I forgot something upstairs. It's not a quick trip up to the room, LOL! All of that said, I would NOT want a room close to the lobby because the lobby was very noisy. I also wouldn't want a room by the pool for the same reason. The savanna view is really the only way to go, in my opinion. My other issue was the noise. It was a bit noisy at times, and sometimes in our room we could hear banging and bumping around in the ceiling. It did not, however, happen all the time nor did it prevent us from sleeping, so again, easily overlooked. All in all, I LOVED this hotel.

We are DVC members, and therefore, have the choice of staying at Kidani or Jambo. Having stayed at both, we overwhelming prefer Jambo. On our most recent visit, we staying in a studio room right above the checkin area (on the 5th fl though) that overlooked the \"Sunset Savannah\" (which probably had nice views of the Sunset before Kidani was placed, directly blocking the sunset). This has become our favorite room out of all the ones in which we have stayed. The minuses (lack of pretty sunset view) are diminished by the many pluses. The next time we go, we will not even go to any of the parks - there is really no need to do so. There are so many things to do - it is almost like one of those resorts on unfriendly islands!! Many animals to watch and photograph on several savannah viewing points, night vision goggles to view the animals at night, available safaris, roasting marshmallows at the campfire at night, outdoor movies by the pool under the palm trees, a cozy bar in the pool area also under the palms with reasonably prices drinks, with and without alcohol, African Art scattered about the property, activities for the kids (that frankly I wanted to do too!), a fun, moderately priced counter-service restaurant (The Mara) with themed food and daily specials for routine meals - and Sanaa (in Kidani) for celebratory and reasonably priced meals. Jiko is a bit too pricy for the food served, and Boma is too much like an extraordinarily expensive Vegas buffet (far too much $$$ for people that don't gorge themselves at meals), not to mention FAR too noisy! The Victorian Falls bar is a nice place to sit and people-watch. The lobby of Jambo outshines the lobby of Kidani by many lumens. We could just hang out in the Jambo House lobby for hours - it reminds us of the Grand Californian lobby. The art, the styling, the fireplace, the waterfall...I can go on and on. Regarding transportation to other places - DAKL is farther away from Downtown Disney and all other parks than any other Disney lodging property. Therefore, bus trips are 30-45 minutes minimum to get anywhere. This must be kept in mind when planning breakfasts and dinners - you must leave at least 2 hours before your desired arrival time to assure that you will not be rushed and worry about being late. The bus systems are not the most efficient and need improvement, but, it is free and you do get where you have to go, and when you are on vacation, that is all that matters. I do think that DAKL should have a smaller shuttle than runs only between there and the AK. It would make too much sense. Also, the amount of people in those motorized carts (not wheelchairs - I am referring to the people that park these carts at entrances and walk about freely until it is time for them to go any distance) and their excessively large entourages should be provided specialized transportation vehicles to minimize the delays, arguments and hostility that do occur. Everyone deserves to enjoy themselves, but people should not be allowed to ruin other guests' vacations because of a feeling of entitlement or priority. The beds are divine - I have no idea why some people complain about them - I have had SIX back and neurological surgeries and I slept wonderfully on the bed. The only issue we have had with the room temperatures was when we stayed in a studio in Kidani - there is some sort of automatic climate control in the bathroom area and it kicks on - loudly - every time someone walked nearby. It lead to an excessively cool area in the room - and excessively noisy! The only difficulty we have had on more than one occasion is with housekeeping - we always seem to be shorted on the supplies (bowls, forks, spoons, pillows, etc.) and it takes 2 or 3 calls to get anyone to deliver more to us. These issues are minor and do not dampen our spirits or our love for DAKL.

Not as big of a slide as you would've expected in this size of pool. A kiddie pool which is secluded from the big pool to keep small ones from wondering away in going for a dip. The hottub was also tucked away. I never went to see it. This place had 2 restaurants available. One a sit down menu and the other a buffet with offerings from a African family's dinner table.

We were taken back by the hospitality of the cast members, ambiance of the decor in Africa style and admired the African collection of art and artifacts. As an educator and teacher of African History and those living in the Diaspora, I was educated and felt so empowered experiencing my homeland and the Motherland, Africa. The children were amazed and enthralled with our Standard view of the Savannah and appreciated completing the animal checklist and fact sheet. The hotel, hallways, and overall decor was breathtaking. The cast members dressed in African attire and may who were from the continent of Africa added to the overall experience of being immersed in Africa. The furniture in the lobby and on the savannah view was amazing. Having a refridgerator was a plus. We loved the balcony and our view ofthe animals. The housekeeping staff were very accomodating. We were hoping that more Disney characters would be visible during our stay. The crafts for the children and African education sessions were great. We loved the arcade and fitness center. The pool was great with the games. On the first day, although we did not have reservations at the BOMA restaurant, we were accomodated and chosen as family of the day and drummed in to the restaurant to open it up. The African drumming and the time that was taken to teach the children the art was awesome. We ate breakfast there twice and dinner twice. We ate at the Mara, my only complaint that the breakfast meal portions (waffles) with the meals werevery small andyou were given only one. Itas a bit pricy forsmall meals. At the BOMA, My only reservation, is that the prices were not posted until the day before we left and the prices are extremely high. The Zawadi gift shop was really nice hoever, the prices of the fod was quite high. The rooms were nice. A few dust bunnies behind the beds andin crevices of the floor can be given more attention. The bed was a bit uncomfortable. I woke up with back aches on the second day. I just learnedhow to adjust. The room temperature was either cold or hot.

In fact, we like it so much that staying here has become a Christmas time vacation tradition. As soon as you walk in the lobby you are taken away from the hustle of the parks to a much more relaxed and comforting place. At Christmas the 5 story tree centers the lobby and takes center stage with a nearby brook, indoor firepit, and 3 tiered restaurant overlook. Walk outside during the day and you are greated by a variety of safari animals or at night by a large cozy campfire. The kid's playground is set in a quiet corner near the pool and hot tub and filled with fun things for the younger set. The restaurant offerings here are diverse and wonderful from the quick service Mara (which has great flatbreads and yummy curry stew) to the grand buffet Boma (come hungry and leave more than satisfied) and elegant signature dinning restaurant Jiko (ask for to be sat in the wine room for a trully romantic evening). Want something extra special -- book the concierge level where the cast members go above and beyond to make your vacation perfect and the on going food options keep you satisfied and happy. Some people complain that Animal Kingdom Lodge is distant from the parks as you need a bus or car to get to all 4 of them, but for us that is a bonus. Its great to escape from all the hustly of the parks and the longest bus ride is Magic Kingdom at only about 20 - 25 minutes. Disney is fun and magical, but sometimes its great to get a-way and relax. Animal Kingdom Lodge is the perfect place to do just that.

We got to our room, and had no room keys in the packet... The rooms hadn't changed at all since we were their in 2006- even the same polyester bedding.lol. But all in all they were still in good condition. The outside viewing area also looked a little run down. They need to add more greenery. It was nice because everyday at 4pm they added leaves to the trees, so the giraffs would wonder over and eat. Kids loved that. We heard the new sister property the Kidani Village is nice because they have mini kitchen and they are brand new. The pool at the Jambo houes (main lodge where we stayed) was pretty nice still, a bit cold. The little kid pool is sad and run down. We did go over the sister property pool at The Kidani Village one day and had a blast. They offer a van every 5 minutes at the bell station. It isn't advertised, but worked great. The pool was so kid friendly with a special area for the little ones. The staff was great about organizing fun things for kids aged 5-10 with music and games. I even had 20 minutes to read my book. The resturant at the hotel at the lodge was so expensive but the food was really good. The buffet was worth it. I just wish they had a side menu for kids. My four year old just wanted something small like noodles and veggies, but you have to pay the $25 for little ones as well. My son was sick in the room, and they kindly brought us soup for free to take back with us. The food at Kidani's resturant was so good too. It was not buffet, and the choices were unique, but we really enjoyed it. They did a special dessert for my daughter which was sweet. Nice wait staff. The food in the cafeteria was well priced for what you got. We shared an entree and the kids did too, and it was plenty. They had a nice selection of wine for $15 (shocked me) so we took a bottle up to the room. The refillable cups are nice so you don't have to keep paying for kids drinks, you can use them all week at both properties. All and all it was a great trip. We left there for a Disney Cruise (which was beyond cool) and that was all very organized by the hotel in terms of luggage, etc. The lobby was just beautiful for Christmas, and because of the time of year, not too crowded anywhere we went. Lastly, the buses. for the most part it was pretty slick. It is a drive to most parks from this property (20 plus minutes). Animal kingdom is the closest obviously. One day we waited 1 hour for the Magic Kingdom bus, and people were so angry. For those of us that didn't throw a fit, they handed out fast pass rides to use later in the day. I felt really bad for the poor man working that day. Next time however, we will stay on one of the closer properties. All and all great 4 days.

We had to move. Disney during the Christmas break found us a room at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Thank you Disney staff! They were wonderful at the Coronado Springs Hotel in finding us a new room. Lots of magic moments including a ride over to help us out to the Animal Kingdom Lodge after a long plane flight and tired children. I can't say enough about their service. They warned us though about the Animal Kingdom Lodge using the same chemicals but it was night and day in what the rooms smelled like and we visited three different rooms at the Coronado Springs Hotel. It was well worth the upgrade. We saw some of the other premium hotels and some of them felt a little dated. The Animal Kingdom Lodge was a welcome respite to the activities of the park. I loved it each time I went into the lobby. It was an impressive lobby done right. This hotel provided us with our own oasis. We spent five nights and never grew tired of the night vision goggles, the great staff, the wonderful food, the drumming and the animals right outside our door. Tips we came to realize on this trip: Ask ahead of time to have your room cleaned with non chemical cleaners. The WDW dining plan will have you put on pounds even if you are walking all day long. We would not due a Disney Dining plan again. The extra shows like the luau and western review are a little dated. We still love character breakfasts with our children. We prefer the intimacy of Disneyland to the size of WDW. If you do plan on going ... budget for cabs. When you figure out the time spent in public transportation contrasted to the cost of the park tickets, hotel and food ... it is a nominal addition to save time, save on walking and cabs just make it easy getting around the park. We budgeted cab fares into our vacation and we are glad we did. The one time we had to take a bus it took over an hour to get to the venue.

We found the Mara counter service restaurant to be very good as well (flatbreads, salads and breakfasts great - muffins, coffee etc just OK). Our room was a ground level pool view room and it was perfect. The outdoor seating area in these rooms is larger than for those above and the beautiful gardens have matured enough to create a lot of privacy. Our children are young, so this gave us a great spot to relax after they had gone to bed. These rooms have easy access to the pool, The Mara, outdoor movies, nightvision animal viewing, Simba's Club House and are a comfortable walk to the lobby and buses. Overall the hotel is fun for children and relaxing for adults. Transportation to Magic Kingdom and other parks was not a problem for us, eventhough the location is distant. There was one morning that the bus to Animal Kingdom had a mechanical problem, otherwise transportation was great.

As such, I find negative reviews to be more helpful. This review, however, is not a \"negative\" review. I am going to give a practical and helpful review to people staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I am going to break it down into various sections for easier comprehension. This was my 50th trip to Disney World, and I have now stayed at all but 2 Disney Hotels, so I think I have a good basis of comparison. The Staff The staff at the AKL was courteous and friendly, as you would expect with a Disney hotel. Occasionally we ran into a less-than-chipper employee, but sometimes people have bad days. The Restaurants There are 3 restaurants at the AKL plus 1 quick service restaurant. The restaurants are overpriced and weird. Boma is a buffet with normal American buffet food, but is very expensive. The other 2 restaurants have African food. It was weird. I'm sure if you're into ethnic food, you'd love these restaurants. I do not. The Animals All else aside, the ONLY reason to stay at the AKL is the novelty of looking out the window and seeing animals. I've read some reviews that said they didn't see any animals. This is B.S. The animals are everywhere. If you walk into the hotel and look out the back window you will see dozens of various animals. Zebras, Wildebeest, Giraffes, etc. If you are worried about seeing enough animals to justify the costs, don't. You will see them. The Room Most of the negative reviews I have read on here complain about the room. Let me set it straight right now. IT IS A HOTEL ROOM! You get either a bed and a pull out couch, or 2 beds. There's a TV, a bathroom, and a closet. I don't know what people expect. It looks just like every other hotel room you have ever stayed in. If you are in your room for more than 2 waking hours per day while in Disney World you are wasting your money anyways. It's just a plain, ordinary hotel room. You sleep shower and change there. That's it. We had a savannah view. Again, I've read several reviews that said people couldn't see any animals from their room. Again, wrong. There were dozens outside our room at all hours of the day, especially at night when we got back from the parks. And if you think that maybe I just had a good room, you are wrong. There are windows in the hallways, every 40 feet or so, on both sides of the hallway, so you can see pretty much the whole savannah. There were always animals outside. If you are paying the small fortune for the room with the savannah view, rest easy, you will see animals. The Pools There are 2 pools. One at the Jambo House and one at the Kidani Village. No matter which house you stay at you get access to both pools. the Kidani Village pool is cooler to look at. The Jambo House pool is boring looking. Just a pool and a slide. But, the bar was nicer at the Jambo House. Both pools are nice. The Transportation As I said at the beginning of this review, I have been to Disney World now 50 times. So, take what I am about to say to heart: There is only 1 real reason to stay at a Disney hotel, and that is their transportation system. Orlando has no shortage of hotels, and there are plenty very close to Disney World. Most just as nice, all a lot cheaper. But, Disney does a phenomenal job making it very difficult for people not staying at their hotels to get to their parks, in order to encourage people to stay at Disney hotels. AKL is far away from the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT Hollywood Studios and Downtown Disney. 20-30 minutes on the bus. It is close to the Animal Kingdom Park (obviously). It takes a long time. It\u2019s not a big deal if you are like me who went on this past trip with 2 adults. We can deal with the long bus ride at the end of the night. But if you have small children, watch out. The busses at the end of the night are crowded (I'll get to that next) and seats are hard to come by. You will be stuck holding your kids the whole bus ride as they sleep in your arms, for the entire 20-30 minute bus ride. I have also read a lot of complaints saying that the buses don't run very often. I did not find this to be true. The buses were a little slower than most other hotel's buses (5 minutes or so on the whole) which does not sound like much, and really it's not. But, the AKL is CROWDED. As it is a very crowded hotel, the lines for the buses at the parks fill up fast. Since the bus lines fill up so fast, it makes every bus very crowded. At the end of the night you will generally have to wait for 2 or 3 buses (depending on the time of year and how crowded the park is). If you have little kids, waiting all that time, and having to stand the whole ride back is not fun. Overall Overall, the AKL is a great hotel. But it's not without its drawbacks. It\u2019s far away and VERY EXPENSIVE. The only reason people book this hotel is the novelty of seeing the animals. Let me tell you, that novelty wears off quickly. My honest assessment is that the AKL is not worth it. So, why would I say the AKL is a \"great hotel\" and then say it is not worth it? It's simple. This isn't a beach resort, where you stay at the hotel the whole trip. This is Disney World. When you go to Disney World you go for the parks. AKL is not convenient for visiting the parks, except Animal Kingdom. For the kind of money it costs to stay at the AKL you can stay at the Contemporary, Yacht and Beach Club, Wilderness Lodge, Boardwalk, etc. If you want to see the animals, take the safari tour at Animal Kingdom Park, or just go out to the AKL and eat at one of the restraints one night.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "Traveller0984", "ReviewID": "UR122116170", "Content": "This hotel really is fab, my husband & I stayed here for 5 nights and the staff were excellent, the rooms were really comfortable, it has an excellent pool, buffet restaurant and a convenient shuttle service to all the parks, waterparks and downtown Disney.

The property is very noisy, as is the case with all the parks as well. Kids everywhere, but that is what Disney is all about. The room was the one relatively quiet escape spot from the throngs. A nice perk for me was the golf transportation. Most people do not have their own cars, and Disney arranges for you to be picked up by a cab, gratis, and transported to their golf venues. They even pay the tip.

Carpet,King bed was so comfy, clean crisp linens, the bathroom was the size of a small temple. Jacuzzi tub, and a huge glass shower with bench seat and water pressure to die for. Two sinks, large vanity, toilet was in a closet without AC vent, and a mirror on the back of the door, Very strange. but whatever...Plenty of storage in both bedrooms and LG TV's. The rooms have energy saving lights , but not enough wattage. good luck with the make-up ladies. the rooms are darker than what is comfortable at night and early am. IMO. Second bedroom had two queens, carpet, door to balcony, full bathroom and pvt. water-closet, LOL, same complaint there, double vanity. 3rd full bath as you come into the unit, across from the utility closet.Nice to have I guess, but unnessary IMO. I would have rather the extra living space. More on that in a second. The washer dryer were the larger stacked ones we love and they have switched from tide to ALL detergent, for those with allergy concerns.also, vacuum and brooms and mops here as well. We had views off the living area as well. animals almost all the time as there were several feeding stations right off our balcony. WE saw Zebras, Giraffe's, Ankole Cattle, Ostrich, Stork, and many others daily and frequently. it was great, for about 4 days, then the novelty wore off and it became more about the L O N G walk to the lobby or buses. So long, that we only used the bus to animal kingdom, the rest of the time we drove our own car, MUCH easier! We were close to the pool, just down the elevator to the parking garage, down one mod and out and the pool is between Pumba and Timon parking garages. ( all visitor parking is underground and pretty cool.) It sounds wimpy but after walking around the parks all day, to then come back to your hotel and have to schlep a mile to anywhere you might want to go at home base gets OLD even for young legs! About the Kitchen/living space... what there is of it. We had 6 peeps in a room that could sleep 8 plus two crib sleepers... it was over crowded to the extreme. The brand new LG TV was awesome, problem, one love seat that was not too comfy and one chair you'd have to move to see the TV. Table had room to be bigger but sat 4 comfortably, and two stools at the small counter.Stools, without backs, so little kids can't sit there. (There are two highchairs in the room along with a pack and play in each bedroom closet.) After a day at the parks the kids wanted to play with toys or sit and color, it got cramped. The Kitchen is galley style so only one in there at a time, period. there was room for more cupboards on the far wall, but it was empty. No crockpot, ( good thing we brought our own), the plates were small square things the kids could not use and the bowls were all very tiny, so instead of being able to get dressed and ready as the kids ate, you were pouring bowl #2. We cook our main meals there as 300 bucks a day on food is a bit much for us. I can feed all 6 of us for about 30 bucks a day by going to publix, and Disney meal plan is about 39 a day per person! That's one reason why we became DVC members, we cook simple meals, and save money to do other things! Was the trade off worth it, small kitchen and Living space so we could see the animals... yes, for about 4 days. day 5 and 6 became an exercise in patience as we all tried to exist in a space to small for us. THe pool activities were on the hour starting from 1pm -5pm. lots of fun. Community Hall had a couple of crafts going almost all the time and as we always find, the cast members there are fun and great with the kids. But again, by day 4 even the kids were tired of the long walk. Thankfully we were close to the pool, and the weather was ok, so they headed there a couple times and loved the pool, hot tub, and slide! we used online check in, so only had to get our keys and room assignment. they let you pick now. If it's not to busy and we got into our room about 11am. We loved it here, don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, clean, and the animals are worth any other hassle... Next time, we'll stay here 3 days, and at another resort 3 days. For a shorter trip, not sure I'd recommend unless you HAVE to see the animals, try another resort at WDW. Also, FYI the other lodge, Jambo, has a better restaurant offer, but the pool is just ok unless you have really little ones, like 3-4 and they can't swim.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "SV", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "mullSv", "ReviewID": "UR121780732", "Content": "This place is amazing!

Given that it's only a few hours from where we live, it's always been a great family-friendly option for a weekend away. In the past, however, we've always stuck with moderate or off-property hotels. This time was different. I saw an on-line ad for Disney's fall hotel sale and promptly called the Disney Reservations Center. The agent was able to secure a room at the AKL for roughly the same price as POFQ. I booked the hotel and couldn't be any happier. Reception: I was so appreciative to be greeted by helpful valets and concierge staff at the entrance to Jambo House. I was happy to have the car off my hands and someone on-hand to give me a quick overview of the property and lead me straight to check-in. My check-in agent was exceedingly professional and courteous and took care of all of my reservation needs promptly. He was even able to accomodate my request for a room near transportation. After a smooth check-in, we took a five-minute walk to our room which was in a really great location- just a flight above the lobby. Room: The room was thoughtfully appointed. I appreciated the attention to detail; however, I quickly noted that the hotel room and appointments were fairly standard. The hotel room did seem a bit small (even for three people) so I was concerned about luggage storage. The closet helped a bit, but the space underneath the sinks was a life-saver. The fridge was as expected- a life-saver :) We also had a standard-sized table which was handy, but it was a little tight with even two people sitting at it. I know that the resort offers room service, but to be honest, I don't know that it would be very comfortable to have a meal in the room. There just wasn't enough space. Property Details/Thoughts The quick-service cafe was pleasant. I liked that the resort arranged to have a staff member to take guests orders, submit a ticket to the cooks, and provide us with beepers. This courtesy made dining all the nicer. All in all we enjoyed our meals here. The food is standard resort-fare; it is American with an African touch. Breakfast was fairly typical. I found the portions to be huge so I ordered a little less than I thought three people would want. That was a good call. Because we were at the parks so much, we did not get to enjoy many of the perks of the property, but I did make some observations: I regret that we did not keep our reservations at the sit-down restaurants. They, like the property, were gorgeous. Also, the gym was very modern and well-maintained. If I could have, I would have brought my exercise clothes. The pool area is very attractive and there is plentiful seating. Do be advised that the recreation facilities are spread out. It was easy to get turned around while on the property. Other Observations: This would be a great hotel for a family who is coming to the resort for several days and who wants to stay at a resort that allows them diversion for when they wish to take a day off from the parks. I say that because there are many, many activities for resort guests to participate in- the schedule comes with your welcome packet. Like I said earlier, the dining and recreation facilities are nice. The arcade is well-maintained and is monitored by security in the evening. Children came with their parents as late as 9:30 or 10pm. They seemed to have a good time while there. Finally, I know there is wildlife viewing.

We booked a club level room in the main resort for 3 nights in October. From the moment we drove up to the gate, we were made to feel like honored guests. The resort is just amazing and because it maintains low lighting and a respectfully quiet atmosphere for the animals, it feels so serene; a wonderful respite from the hectic parks. The rooms are on the small side of standard, but the savanna view makes up for that. They are dark; but again- so peaceful. We enjoyed the pool area with its hidden whirlpools and easy integration into the savannas. I wandered right up to one of the public savanna views and enjoyed talking with the cultural ambassadors from Africa who were very friendly and eager to teach us about the animals. We ate at Sanaa (Table service) and Mara (Quick Service) which were both excellent. However, we do enjoy Indian and Thai flavors on a regular basis so read the menus first to see if it works for you. Having the club level was very nice; check in was relaxing on the club floor where there was even a wii provided for our sons entertainment. We also enjoyed the light breakfast and could also grab some fruit to go as a snack during our daily adventures and we also utilized their extensive movie collection for our son. There is so much to do at the resort; you could spend a day or so there alone. Bring Binoculars for more up close viewing. However, we saw animals at all times and even sleeping at night. There are plenty of viewing spots so it never felt crowded or 'zoo' like.

I can definitely see where if you wanted to go back to the hotel for a nap midday and then return to the parks that it would be difficult if you plan on using the shuttles because it did take about 30-45 minutes to get from there to any of the parks, so you are looking at an hour round trip minimum to leave and come back.

It is the best Disney hotel I have stayed at. I must admit I have always wanted to stay here as I love giraffes and whilst visiting in December we ate at Jiko and I fell even deeper in love with the place. We booked a standard view room and I can't fib I was hoping that as it was our anniversary they would upgrade us to a savannah view room based on other reviews I had read. They didn't upgrade us and we had a standard view room on the giraffe trail overlooking the entrance - but hey we can't complain we didn't pay for a savannah view room and lots do! Do I regret not booking a Savannah view? Actually no I don't we were only there for a week so we didn't spend that much time in our room. There are plenty of viewing spots around the hotel and whenever we used them there was never anyone else there anyway - though it was low season. I actually think that even if we had been in a room with a view of the savannah we would have spent more time in the viewing areas as this is not a zoo so the animals roam freely and if there were no animals out we could and did just move to another viewing area. The main viewing areas accessed from around the pool and lobby are lovely and marked on the resort map. There are however lots of viewing balconys along the corridors to the rooms which are not marked. Our room was very close to the lobby about three doors from the stairs or lifts and neither side of this trail has savannah views so we wouldn't have known about this had we not been exploring the hotel. These non-marked viewing areas were almost better but please if you use these be quiet and don't disturb the other guests. The night vision viewing is great and free and will only take about 5 mins from your evening ask about it when you check in. We did notice on our second night that our balcony was above the smoking area which isn't very nice when you are a non smoker but as we were only there a week and had unpacked I didn't raise it so I can't complain about it. We didn't use our balcony for anything other than drying swimsuits (which didn't smell of smoke) but just mentioning it as it may be worth checking if this would bother you. Though there must only be a couple of rooms affected by this. Our room was beautifully appointed with 2 queen beds ,fridge & coffeemaker. The beds and pillows were comfortable and we slept very well though wherever we have stayed at WDW we have slept well as you are on the go all day!!! Shower was powerful, water always hot, room always immaculate, coffee always topped up (though they give you packs with sugar, sweetener, serviettes and stirrers so to avoid waste we just took sachets of sweetner from the food court). I have read reviews that say the rooms are small and dark I strongly disagree. Yes the furniture is a dark colour and the walls aren't white washed so the rooms will be darker if you are used to white washed walls, mirrors and glass everywhere but the rooms feel cosy and luxurious (not minimalistic luxury). This is a hotel room if you want space then book DVC appartments. We have stayed in Pop Century(value) and Port Orleans French Quarter (moderate) and you can see a slight difference in the decor and furnishings as you increase the grade. I have enjoyed all of the places we have stayed at in WDW but I have stayed at them for different reasons. Animal Kingdom Lodge was perfect for just the two of us to spend time together and we got a great deal with a free dining plan. Though it isn't just for couples there were a whole host of things on for kids and you could quite easily stay here for a week with kids and keep them entertained without the need to step foot in the parks. The pool was lovely though quite warm which was great for a quick dip in the evenings, not sure if it would have been great for cooling down on really hot days though. Although if we did visit the pool in the day nowhere seemed to be a particular sun trap so not sure it's ideal for people who just want to lie in the sun. It looks so inviting particularly in the evening when it is lit up. We ate at all 3 dining locations. Jiko the signature restaurant is amazing you could forget you were at Disney it is probably the quietest romantic restaurant there and the food is delicious. We ate a Boma for breakfast, great selection and a perfect place for breakfast on our last day as most days we just had cereal it would have been too much food every other day! The food court Mara is ideal too try the african stew mmmm. We also ate at Saana at Kidani village the food was nice but the view of the Savannah whilst eating was what made the experience great. The buses were great we never waited more than 10 mins for one and the journeys werent that long. The longest journey was Magic Kingdom which varied from 15-20 mins. We were on holiday it was nice to not have to think about driving and if you are impatient and don't like waiting this isn't really the holiday for you because you will queue for pretty much everything - although not very mong in September. Chill out, relax and enjoy your surroundings and secure those memories for ever. The shop by the lobby is great lots of disney souveniers and essentials like milk bread cereals etc. If you can try to spend a part of each day exploring the things the hotel has to offer whether that is getting a glass of wine and sitting by the fire inside or reading a book in the beautiful lobby. It is these things you won't get in value or moderate resorts. Ths staff is great. Service on the whole, even by disney standards, is exceptional (the lady who checked us in was a bit grumpy but once we started chatting to her she lightened up), I would stay here again in heartbeat, yes it is expensive but it is beautiful. If you don't stay here at least visit. We got a great deal for our week and we have decided we would like to visit as many of the properties as we can so are staying at Old Key West in 2012 but I will definately go back and visit Animla Kingdom Lodge because it has a serenity and excitement that other places dont.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery nice would stay again, It can be for children and adults\u201d", "Author": "Hailey G", "ReviewID": "UR120772347", "Content": "I am 18 and have loved Disney for as long as I can remember. I live in florida and only about an hour away from Disney but stay at the hotels anyway because they are fun and its a great way to get away from it all. I have read reviews about the Animal Kingdom Lodge and I have a few things to say about them, I have stayed here a number of times, Yes the lobby area is a little dark, BUT you must resize this is part of the vibe and decoration of the place along with the dark wood floors, and if you are going to complain about this, then you are spending way to much time in the lobby and should get to a park or a pool. Another thing, They offer rooms with bunk beds so the children and adults do not have to stay in the same bed, I have seen these rooms and they are the same size as all of the other rooms, so they basically squeeze the bunk bed in there which dose not leave much space BUT, If you are going to complain about that you are spending way to much time in the rooms, they are there to sleep and maybe relax after the parks, not spend your entire vacation, or if you want to I recommend upgrading to a villa. (I have not yet stayed in a villa but will be this Christmas). If your kids want french fries or basic American food the restaurant are not for you, These restaurant are made to be authentic African food. so do not expect that, On the other hand they have a quick service station that does serve that kind of food along with other things for the adults. When it comes to the walk depending on where you are the walk will vary. In the Kidani Village the walk to the MAIN lobby can be far but it has a lobby of its own. it is smaller because there are less rooms in the Kidani Village. they have to fit as many rooms in the hotel as possible so a long walk for some is needed. Animals....They can not be controlled to the point where you will see them outside your room every time you look out. They roam, so if you are exspecting to see them every time you look outside then look someplace else. Some things I loved about it is the lot os so big you can explore it for hours and not get bored. there are tons of things to do and see and you get get to other parks and resort easy. I also love the beds and how quiet it was. ~This is a very nice Hotel and resort , I highly recommend it.

While it was a bit pricey the afternoon safari through the grounds and dinner at Jiko was amazing. The tour was great and the guide took her time and answered all our questions. We got up close and personal with all the animals. And the dinner at Jiko was AMAZING, you got to taste everything on the menu, it was just course after course after course of delicious food! Being a Disney resort, transportation around Disney was a breeze. No need to rent a car. However, Animal Kingdom Lodge seems to be a bit more removed from some parks, so make sure you leave enough time to get to the parks, some are a good half hour bus ride away. Check out was a breeze.

I stayed with my wife and 3 year old on an Arusha View room. The lobby of the hotel is really nice, spacious and promises a good experience. That ends when you go to check in. There was nothing wrong with my reservation, but it took the receptionist a good 30 minutes to enter our names in the system and hand us the room keys with a bunch of pamphlets explaining what to expect. We book the package through Expedia and had also the park hopper vouchers which were explained that needed to be handed over at the desk so we can get our park tickets. The receptionist told us after checking with his supervisor that the concierge desk will assist us. So here we go to another line waiting for another 20 minutes even though only two of the three concierges were actually providing service and the third one was staring at some wall behind our backs. Long story short, the concierge explained to us that they do not issue tickets for the parks as they cannot access the system if the tickets were booked through Expedia but we have to go to one of the customer service offices at any park entrance and get the tickets. We did go at one of the office in Downtown Disney and were asked why were we bothered to come all the way here instead of getting the tickets at the concierge desk, I changed subject and moved on. Now let's move to the room...Once we opened it we got stung by a smell comparable only to a pile of mulch. I went immediately outside to complain but returned right back as the room next door opened the door and had the same scent coming out, I guess there was no point requesting to exchange rooms. After 30-45 minutes in the room, you just get used to it to the smell. The balcony view was nice and the little one enjoyed watching zebras and giraffes roaming the grass. That night we went to dine at Boma and were told to wait since we had no reservations, even though the restaurant was half empty and had a row of waiters in line greeting the occasional guest. The food at Boma was good, the buffet has a lot of choices but nothing exceptional, which is OK since they cater mostly to folks that are on dining plans. We did not a have a dining plan as we did not want to limit our choices. Two days in the row we saw cockroaches in the hallway which was not something you expect from a deluxe or high end hotel, especially if you are shelling 300+ USD per night. The bedding was going well with the room, you get a king size bed that has about 6-7 small pillows in a row that look like Swedish meatballs you eat at IKEA - very uncomfortable. The bed sheets were very thin and looked well past their prime time, same thing needs to be said about the towels. The bathroom was spacious and well maintained. We did not try any other restaurant other than the Mara for to go breakfast. The cleaning ladies were very helpful and they were the only four star service that I experienced. The parks had a lot more choices of good food especially Epcot but that will be another review.

My husband and I were traveling with our 2 boys ages 5 &7. The surroundings make you feel relaxed and on vacation especially after coming home from the theme parks. We looked forward to coming back to the room to see what animals were out. Everytime we looked out, we were not disappointed. There were lots of animals right outside from our balcony. We had a room on Zebra Trail with bunk beds.This really added to our trip. We had a great time in the pool and hot tubs. We did the night vision goggles which was really neat. We also had a fabulous meal at Boma. On the downside, the beds and pillows were not comfortable. We had towel animals on our first day but then none after that. We tipped well thinking that they would make the extra effort. The kids look forward to those little extra touches. I found myself dreading the transportation. Starting another day at the parks with standing on a crowded, to the max, bus with people standing in the isle back to back. This is not a good way to start or end a day at the parks. Every bus that comes to the Jaba House is packed with people from the previous stop. I thought going to Hollywood Studios would be a better experience since it is about 6 minutes from the hotel. I timed it when we passed Hollywood Studios on the way back from the Magic Kingdom. To my surprise, the journey to Hollywood Studios is longer since the bus makes a stop at Blizzard Beach before heading to Hollywood Studios. We found that this was the case even if no one on the over-crowded bus was going to Blizzard Beach. The bus stops there on the way back too. We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge last year and found ourselves missing the quick enjoyable boat ride to and from the Magic Kingdom. We never stood on a bus or had any dreadful transportation problems. Next time we will go back to the Wilderness Lodge or a monorail hotel.

First of all, people considering the AKL should distinguish between rating the hotel 5 stars because their vacation experience was great and rating a hotel for what it actually is (amenities, space, comfort, cleanliness, value, etc.). It is very easy to get carried away by the magic of disneyworld and forget that the room you paid a ton of money for is little better than a motel. It's true that when you first enter the AKL you are immersed in the splendor of the lobby and overwhelmed by seeing the animals on the savannah from the viewing decks. It makes you so excited that you initially overlook how ridiculously small and cramped your room is because you head straight for the balcony to checkout the premium savannah view you paid for. You're so excited you tell yourself that soon there will be a giraffe off your balcony and antelope drinking from the pond by your room--even though all you can see are pelicans and can barely make out a zebra well over 100 yards away. But reality quickly sets in. The sticker on your sliding glass door that says \"don't feed the animals\" is unnecessary because you couldn't dump your garbage off your balcony remotely close enough to an animal to notice even if you wanted to. There's NO room to move around in the room and with the bunkbed you feel like you are sleeping in a glorified tent. The bathroom is tiny--the kind of tiny where if you are sitting on the throne the bathroom door can't budge. the fixtures are old and the towels are the same as those found in a holiday inn express--a couple of ours had holes and stains. The carpet is old, the bed is uncomfortable, and the sheets are like sandpaper. Look, it's Disney so I'm not expecting silk or Egyptian cotton, but I expect something better than motel sheets. In my opinion, anyone who thinks the actual hotel accommodations are 4 or 5 stars is either objectively biased by \"Disney magic\" or has never stayed at a true 4 or 5 star resort. No 4 or 5 star resort should ever have a motel quality room period. The savannah view was 100% disappointing. The kids looked out at all times of the day hoping to see animals and were not impressed. By the second day, they stopped caring and really we ended up paying for a view we didn't really enjoy. Temper your expectations of the savannah view if you stay here. You will get FAR better views at the animal kingdom park itself! Save your money and go on the Kilimanjaro safari and animal trails in the theme park. Having said that, the good points of the hotel include a beautiful lobby, lots of little activities for the kids around the resort, easy access to excellent restaurants, and friendly Disney hotel workers. We had a rental car the entire time which we loved because we never had to wait around for the Disney buses and parking is free at all the theme parks. The drive to the theme parks really isn't bad at all. Disneyworld itself absolutely is a fun, magical place and a must-do if you have kids, but skip the AKL--especially if staying in a NICE room is important to you.

This was our third time at the Lodge, and second time staying Club Level. When we arrived at Animal Kingdom Lodge, the Security Guard took my ID, gave me my parking pass, and Welcomed me Home. That felt nice, it was the first I\u2019d heard it in almost 3 years. He even radioed ahead to let the attendants know that a Club Level guest was arriving. We pulled under the porte-cochere, hopped out of the car, and everyone just stood around looking at us. We started getting all of our luggage out, still, everyone stood looking at us. As we started hauling everything in, someone finally approached us, asked if we were the Brandeaus, and offered to escort us to the Lounge for check-in. Not once were we offered Bell Service, nor any help with our luggage. Once at the Lounge, check-in was a bit of an ordeal. The girl couldn\u2019t figure out how to assign us a room since none were ready (which was understandable, since we were there almost 3 hours before check-in), and once they did figure it all out, they told us we\u2019d have to take our luggage back downstairs to check it with Bell Service. Internally, I almost exploded. I didn\u2019t pay over $400/night to continuously cart my luggage around. Luckily, before the last few things were finalized (and after I\u2019d wandered over to grab some lemonade and a cookie from the food area, yum yum, free food), she corrected herself and offered to have Bell Service come pick up our luggage. We were told we\u2019d get a text when our room was ready. We got the text a few hours later, so off to our room. Two Queens instead of the King I had requested, but we were expecting that. AKL really needs more Club Level King Rooms. The one thing I was not expecting was the lack of Welcome/Birthday Package for Rin that has always been given to us for a special occasion (it has a small gift, note and, in this case, Birthday Pin). Strike... um... 3, I think. We got our luggage, unpacked, and I went back up to the Lounge to get scissors and ask about the package for Rin. It turns out they were behind on delivering them, and by the time I got back to the room, she had received it. Yay! They now give a replica Baobob Tree and AKL Pen. I should mention too that Carmen (the woman that I was dealing with at this point, I think I referred to her as Carmella on a 'live' post) was amazing, and made up for any previous issues. She even gave me three roses out of their flower arrangement to give to Rin as a birthday gift. The only problem with Carmen is that she wasn't there the whole time. Fast forward a few days, and I needed a suit pressed. Housekeeping was amazingly attentive, prices were good, and I had my suit back before the end of the day. After all of the stuff happening on day 1, the rest of our stay was uneventful. Most of the staff I dealt with in the Lounge were really good, Housekeeping kept our room neat and tidy throughout the stay, and as always, the views and general feel of the Lodge was amazing. If I had never stayed here before, or if I had never dealt with the Club Level staff before, I probably would have rated this a 4, or likely 5.

The average ride was about 20 min to the parks, other than Animal Kingdom, which went by rather quickly. The room it self was nice but maybe a little small to roll a stroller in and out of but that wasn't that big of a deal. The beds were nice but the box springs were a little noisy getting in and out of bed. The resort though was very quiet with only one night of people that were load. The workout room was very nice and the pool area as well was nice and fun for the little one. The quick serve restaurant by the pool left something to be desired but most of them around the parks do the same. All the staff were nice and helpful while we were there and new towels and such were there every day when we came back for a mid day break. would highly recommend this resort for any one and will be back again.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cIt's Nice, but It's Tight\u201d", "Author": "Mike N", "ReviewID": "UR119956454", "Content": "We stayed at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge, in a room converted from a standard hotel room to a Disney Vacation Club studio villa, and this room did not live up to what was billed to be a Deluxe accomodation.

The basic layout includes a sofa, queen-sized bed, a table with two chairs, a VERY small bureau and an equally VERY small cabinet for your clothes. There wasn't enough room for two-week's worth of clothes for two adults...let alone if there were kids included. There also was a two-bowl sink area, a seperate bath with tub/shower, in addition to the wetbar. Was this room what we expected for a deluxe room...? No. But it's Disney, and folks want to stay there, so Disney puts together what they think works, and people just have to take what Disney gives them. Yes, there were suppose to be wild animals right outside our room (in Jambo House), but they were usually someplace else when we were in the room.

After spending a week in Aruba, ande 2 nights at the Dolphin we were looking forward to staying the night and day of my wife's birthday there. If you're into seeing animals you can see at almost any zoo from far away then thi splace is great, but definitely not worth the money. Well first they must have given our room to someone else and gave us a vacation club room with a different view of the savannah than what we had booked, which hey who cares its our honeymoon and her birthday we were just excited to celebrate. The room wasnt going to be ready for another few hours so we decided to head to the park. We walk down to catch the Bus to Animal Kingdom, when someone tells us that the bus only comes every 20 to 25 minutes. We walk down anyway and find a crowd of people also waiting. By the time the bus comes the bus stop was packed and we had to wait for the second bus to even get a spot to stand up. The way back to the hotel was even worse. The line for the bus stretched almost from the bus stop all of the way to the entrance area and we had to wait for 3 buses just to be crammed into a bus that was filled to capacity. By the time we got back to the hotel we were late to our reservation at JIKO and they told us that missing your reservation was subject to a 50 dollar fee, which we later found out wasnt true. Then we asked the concierge Michele, who was excellent, if there was anything she could do and she helped us and told us that JIKO would have atable ready for us whenever we got down there from changing. We finally recieve our room and it had to be a 10 minute walk from the lobby. This hotel is absolutely huge and everything except for the savannah view was far from the room. Then we get down to JIKO and we tell them that we are there and the concierge called and they told us that we would still have to wait 15 minutes for a table even though the concierge told us otherwise. After waiting we ate and I liked the food, however it wasnt my wife's taste, but I sampled hers and thought it was good also, so on the food front it was good. Then we get our bill for check out and there are 2 fees that cost 22 dollars a piece totalling 50 dollars in fees for one night on top of the almost 400 dollars we spent to stay there one night! So we check out and we leave and head to the parks, this time driving, and when i pulled up my parking permit from the hotel was on the dashboard and they let me through and told me that hotel guests in disney get free parking at the parks. The hotel never ever mentioned this not even once. We would have never taken that horrible bus to the park if we had known that. Anyway I know that this is alot of random rambling on, but let me sum it up by saying try JIKO, but the hotel is severely over rated not worth the money just go on the Animal Kingdom safari to see the animals. PS we planned on buying a vacation club timeshare at the Animal Kingdom Lodge before we even stayed there, we are so glad that we tried it because we will never stay there again, and even though we will probably buy into the Disney Vacation Club in the future this hotel will not be on our list of options.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but worth it!\u201d", "Author": "momtraveler01", "ReviewID": "UR119815133", "Content": "It is a one of a kind spot.

After being on hold for over 25 min (which i did not really mind b/c i know they had to check room arrangements) they happily told me that it was not problem they were able to switch some things around so we were able to be in the same room the whole time. When we arrived (4 hours later from a 16hour drive) the lady said oh no you are in this room for these 2 nights and then you need to check out by eleven and we can store your things and then at 3pm you can check into your new room. I said I was on hold with someone for over 25min assuring me that we would not have to move rooms. So, I waited again up at the front desk for over twenty min and they again worked it out so we could be in the same room. We just had to bring our keys up to them after the first 2 nights and get new ones since it was a seperate reservation (crazy, but whatever no big deal just a walk to the lobby). Well, after 2 nights i go up to exchange keys and she says do you have your luggage for me to store? I say no I was told twice we would not have to move......well we did and they were going to move us to another room with a queen bed and bunk beds, i said you're crazy if you think i am going to pack up and move to another small crappy room with bunk beds (me, my boyfriend, and a 3 year old).....so we ended up having to move rooms anyway but at least we got 2 queen beds. You would have no idea these people have been running resorts, parks, restaurants, and everything else for as long as they have. So disorganized.

We had no questions just needed to get to our room. The line was a few people deep, but everyone in the On-line line had lots of questions and the process took 25 min. The lady just before me, got an upgraded room which gave me hope, but we got the room we paid for which was fine. AKL really needs to move the people with questions to the other line while those of us who want to get moving and just get keys can. This process didn't work. The whole time we were there, there was always a wait for Concierge, usually just 5 minutes but never just walk up. Our room had a great view of the pool. We were in Zebra Trail 4020. The room was very small. We have 2 girls 8, 10 plus the two of us, we're averaged size people with enough stuff for 8 nights (we packed light) but it was a tight squeeze. For this much money, there should be more storage and more space. The bathroom area was nice plenty of light. The bathtub/toilet area ok that was where it seemed too dark. 4 of us could not fit on the balcony to be seated, which we were bummed about. We had bought stuff for our breakfast in the am but only seating for 2. The table inside was right in the walkway to the balcony. In the am getting bags packed, eating, putting sunscreen, shoes etc we were always bumping into each other. For this price...not acceptable. The grounds were amazing. We walked all over the whole place including over to Kidani one day. Animals are amazing. I would do Kidani next time for more space though I don't know what the price is. Maybe a split stay here to enjoy the animals on a weekend and then move to more spacious accomodations for the latter part of a trip. The CM that were at the look-out spots were so friendly. We really learned from them. Borrowing the night vision goggles is a must. Very cool. I'm picky about beds and these met my expectations. Comfy bedding. It seemed quiet enough, I didn't hear people above or next to us. The frig in the room was plenty spacious for us:1/2 gallon of milk, juice, beer, yogurt, apples, snacks. I was worried that it would be too small but it was perfect. The coffee maker sitting on top of the frig with stuff to make coffee was difficult. They need some more places in these rooms to set stuff down. We'd make our coffee, try to put milk and sugar and there was just no place. Not a well laid out of thought out room. Only 2 dresser drawers in the room. The parking lot was a long walk, just be ready. But we always found a place. We rented a car, which I would recommend. Just on the other side on AKL on 192 are lots of shopping and places to eat. You can save a ton by having dinner at Olive Garden or picking up coffee and breakfast at McDonalds. Overall, I would not stay here again. The price is just too high for what you get. We spent so much of our time at the parks and didn't spend enough time at our lodging.

The cost of staying here is pretty steep since it\u2019s in the deluxe category, but it\u2019s an experience you really can\u2019t find anywhere else. If you do choose to stay here, I highly recommend paying the extra money to get a savanna view room, as there\u2019s over 30 species of animals on display. If you get a standard view room you can still walk around the property and see a lot of the animals, but nothing beats coming back from a park and relaxing on your porch by watching the animals. I will say that the animals wander all over the savanna and are at different places at different times, so they\u2019re not always there when you\u2019d like. Also, the weather can affect where they are at different times of the day. This means that if you do get a savanna view room, you\u2019re not guaranteed to always see the animals. There\u2019s a very good chance you\u2019ll see animals outside your room, but don\u2019t complain if they\u2019re not there all the time. They\u2019re wild animals, not your pets, so just know that there\u2019s a possibility you might not see many animals from your savanna view room. The hotel location isn\u2019t that great since it\u2019s pretty far from most of the parks and the bus rides are longer than from most other Disney resorts. The lobby is absolutely beautiful, but the way the hotel is set up is very confusing. When you walk into the lobby, you\u2019re on level 3. The hallways on each floor are very, very, very long and if your room is towards the end, you could be walking for a very long time before you reach your room. The lady who checked us in was one of the most unfriendly and unhelpful people I\u2019ve ever met. We also encountered her again at the concierge desk later in the week and she was just as unfriendly and useless then and ruined our mood both times. However, the rest of the staff throughout the property was very friendly and helpful throughout the week. We stayed at the Jambo House building in a standard room with a savanna view. The rooms themselves have a very cool Animal Kingdom theme to them, but there\u2019s really nothing else that stands out from other resort hotels. One of our light bulbs was dead and the room smelled like mold the whole week. The room had a flat screen TV, a refrigerator, an iron and ironing board, a hairdryer, a coffee maker and a safe. The bathroom was very small with a toilet and shower crammed right next to each other, but we did like that the long counter outside the bathroom had 2 sinks. The zero-entry pool is very large, easy for kids to enter and has a water slide. There\u2019s a nice little pool bar that\u2019s open until sunset near the main pool, but I really wish it stayed open later. There\u2019s also a small kid pool, a hot tub and a playground near the main pool. If you ever get some down time, you can work out in the fitness center. There are 3 restaurants on the property \u2013 Jiko (high end), Boma (middle of the road/buffet) and The Mara (low end/cafeteria style). We never got a chance to eat at Jiko because it gets booked up pretty quickly, but Boma had some amazing, unique food, along with some standard food that would please picky eaters and kids. The Mara is open until 11:30 PM and has standard American food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) that you can get fairly quickly most of the time. I believe they stop serving breakfast at 11 AM. There\u2019s a nice little bar/lounge on property that\u2019s on its own little level, but I wish it was open later than midnight, especially on the weekend. The gift shop is very big and has beer, wine and liquor for sale, although the price tag isn\u2019t cheap. There were a ton of activities for kids, such as nightly outdoor movies by the pool, afternoon games by the pool, a children\u2019s activity center and an arcade. As with all Disney parks and hotels, smoking is only permitted in designated locations outside.

It shows Disney is just not ripping people off with an african theme, but that they also appreciate the arts and culture of Africa. Food offered is better than expected ate at the quick service venue and options were fair. Moving around the resort was easy, entering the lobby at the third floor and only having to go up or down a couple of floors to do anything. it was a walk to the room however in a hotel that has thousands of rooms, it is expected to do lots of walking. Bus ride to and from theme parks was fine never had to wait more than 20 minutes as promised. In our weekend trip, never got bored. Rides to parks was a little bit long, however you are paying to be in an african savannah, outside of civilization, so longer rides should be expected and it's nice to have a space not cluttered in disney things all the time in everything. The room we got was smaller than the one we got at the Contemporary resort, however we never felt cramped. The room was very well appointed with very comfortable beds, tables and chairs. Bathroom was on the small side however had everything you expect. The bathroom had some unexpected touches like a note from mickey mouse and his friends and a towel mouse, very cute detail! The balcony is nice, fitting two comfortably. It was nice to have a space to sit down and try see some animals. Did not see as much animals as we expected, only saw the smaller animals and birds wondering around however I guess it's impossible to ensure all animals make appearances all the time.

One tip, have the photographer take a picture of you with YOUR camera too, as they are glad to do so and they tooks some really great shots with ours. Lastly, we did splurge and did one of those in-room decoration packages. Yes, it was pricey but my kids were BLOWN AWAY.

We started going back there instead of eating in the park because the quality was much better than you could get elsewhere. The shuttle bus was also better than I thought. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus to arrive and it was a quick ride to any of the parks. We used the Disney website to book our flight, stay, and tickets all together.

There was Disney magic everywhere during our trip, but I will keep this review focused on the AKL. We had just booked a standard view to save money, and at check-in, the sweet staff member helping us gave us a free upgrade to a savannah view as a little anniversary gift. What a wonderful surprise! Our room was at the end of one of the hallways - it was a ways away from the lobby, but it wasn't a bad thing at all. We enjoyed walking past all the different viewpoints of the savannahs and going out on the various porches to sit in the rocking chairs and watch the animals. We loved our savannah view and were impressed by how much sound the door to our balcony kept out. Everyday our room was tidied up and on our last day, we had an anniversary surprise including AK chocolates waiting for us. Pretty special! During our stay, we ate at Sanaa, the Mara, and had a drink at Victoria Falls. Sanaa has a really cool atmosphere, but get there early if you want a window seat! We had reservations and would've had to wait an additional hour to be seated by the window. The food was very different than what we normally eat, but it was still a really neat experience. We really enjoyed the different breads and dips. The Mara was small and we just had one of the main breakfast entrees. My husband enjoyed his, but I didn't care for mine. It wasn't that the food was bad though, it just wasn't to my taste. The only food-related thing that wasn't good were our drinks at Victoria Falls. I couldn't even finish mine it tasted so bad, and it was just a mojito. On the bright side, though, that mojito was the worst part of our stay, which isn't a lot to complain about. The staff was consistently pleasant and helpful, our room was great, the lodge itself and the grounds it's on are beautiful, and the bus rides to each of the other parks really weren't that bad if you plan for them.

Everything was easy from the time we booked until the time we left. I had used the online check-in which meant that when the Magic Express dropped us off at the lobby, it only took a few minutes for someone to have a welcome package in our hands. No standing in line either. He greeted us at the door and took my name and it was that simple! I was a little surprised when I saw our room on the map because I had booked a pool view room based on a friend's recommendation. We had been given a free room upgrade to a Savannah view room! What a nice surprise. The room was bigger than I had expected based on other reviews, and it was very clean. No problems whatsoever. We were lucky to see lots of animals every day that we were there from morning until night - it really was a special experience that you can't get anywhere else. We watched a few animals fighting & the zebras rolling in the dirt, heard the birds calling, watched the gentle giraffes feeding right by our balcony. Magical. The pool was clean and beautiful. Every afternoon the pool attendants hosted a pool party for the kids which my 5 & 8 yr old really enjoyed. They also showed movies by the pool in the evenings and had campfires & marshmallows too :) We ate at Boma twice - breakfast & dinner and enjoyed both buffets. We also picked up breakfasts at The Mara as well as a late night snack - those zebra domes really are as good as I've heard (and you can get them with a snack credit if you're using the dining plan as we were.) The shopping in the Zawadi Marketplace was nice too - we picked up a few gifts and things on our way out. We also used the hotel's kid's club for childcare one evening. It's Simba's Cubhouse right in the hotel and it included dinner for the kids. $11/hr each child and they had a blast (coloring, arts & crafts, games, video games & they watched a Disney movie) and we had a few hours of quiet - worth every penny :) FYI-I had called to make a reservation the week before we arrived. Afterwards we wished we had used it for another evening so that we could head back to Epcot to enjoy the evening during the wine & food festival. Shuttle buses to the parks ran very often (we never waited more than 5 min! - maybe we were just lucky?) and we made it to each park for opening each morning, which was the best time to get there - no lines at all! The only line I experienced was the one waiting to check my bags in the lobby on our departure day. That was slow moving, but it was a Sunday and a lot of people were headed out that day, so I would recommend making sure you allow time for that. The hotel stowed our carry-on luggage for the day until our flight in the evening, which was very convenient. Also, they allowed us a later checkout which was nice. To prep I read 2 books with good tips in them: One was the Unofficial Guide to DisneyWorld with Kids & the other was Mousejunkies. I know it's an expensive vacation, but we were there the last week of September and the rates were a little better and there were no lines, which made it a really enjoyable experience. It really is a beautiful hotel. Take the time to explore it and enjoy it and feel like you're getting your money's worth, though maybe some of the experience is up to luck - we had no rain & lots of animals to watch.

(And, I plan on staying \"on property\" whenever we can in the future.) The convenience of staying on Disney property was fantastic - it also helped that we were there during the low season (Oct 2 - 7 and crowds were rated around a 3 to 5 out of 10 all week). We booked our trip during a Free Disney Dining Plan offer - very worth it! (Although, if you are already thinking of dates for your vacation - start booking dinning reservations as early as possible - even if you don't actually book your hotel/air reseravations til later!) Because we saved money with the free disney dining plan, we upgraded to a Standard Room - Concierge Level - with this, we had access to personal concierge service - pre-trip and on-site at the concierge level lounge. The lounge offered breakfast in the morning (I had hot oatmeal with fresh fruit every morning - and the kids had their favorite cereal and muffins). The lounge also had snacks throughout the day - and offered appetizers and wine in the evenings. Well worth the extra money (which was less than $200 total). Overall, the staff in the Lounge was fantastic - if you needed soemthing and it wasn't out, you just had to ask and they would provide it. Our children loved having chocolate milk on every visit to the lounge. Another great \"included\" service - Disney's Magical Express - and Transportation. I have seen other reviews complaining that the Magical Express includeds multiple resort stops when coming from/going to the airport - and while this was the case for us, it was really not a big deal and quite frankly I loved walking out of the plane, down to the Magical Express check-in area and getting on a bus - all within 10 mins. We still got to the resort earlier than if we had rented a car - and didn't have to drag our bags everywhere b/c they were transfered for us. when you have 2 kids like we do, this was a BIG deal - and not having to take car seats b/c we used their transportation all week was another SUPER bonus. As far as transportation on property, we only had to wait an extended period of time (~ 20 mins) for a bus to/from the parks on 2 occasions - otherwise, we only waited a few minutes and a bus appeared. Activities at the AK Lodge - wish our kids were a bit older to take advantage of all the activities they offered - but our daugther had a great time every afternoon at the pool during the kids' pool party, hoola hoop contests, etc. Some other activities: A campfire was offered every evening (complete with marshmallows), night vision goggles to see animals in the early evening, and Disney movies out by the pool @ 8pm nightly. Now...the only complaint we had was the food at the resort. While I enjoyed the food offerings at the Animal Kingdom lodge, my husband was not a big fan of the African inspired cuisine. Everything - except the childrens' menu - was made with curry and other similar spices and after our first reservation at BOMA (which I thought was very good! - my husband not so much :-(), I had to cancel our 2 other reservations at the on-site restaurants. If you prefer to return from the park and eat at your hotel, but may not like African inspired cuisine, then this may not be the best hotel for you. Other than this, our meals were excellent all week - from the Quick Service Cantina in Mexico at Epcot (great tacos and salsa!), to the Coral Reef restaurant in Epcot (best Mahi mahi I have had in a long time!) to Wolfgang Puck in Downtown Disney - we had good service and food all week. We went to 2 character meals - Crystal Palace in MK and Disney Junior at Hollywood and Vine (in HS) - both good buffets but a bit rushed. We didn't get a reservation at Cinderella's Table this trip - but was well worth it as food, service, and photos were great and we will go back. Final thoughts: we booked thru AAA - which can save you another 5% or so if you are a member - but I would just as soon book thru Disney the next time since you don't save the 5% if you access another offer like Free Disney Dining with your vacation package.

The hotel itself was excellent, I have read some reviews complaining about the walk but in any hotel of this size you are either going to have a bit of a walk to your room or be waiting on elevators so didn't really find it an issue. Room was a good size for a family of 3 but I think it would be very cramped if going with a family of 4 or more with older children. There was not a lot of storage space for clothes either, most of my clothes were put on top of the unit where the tv was. Every morning we woke up to find giraffes, zebras etc at our balcony because that is were they got fed in the morning, my son absolutely loved this every morning. The pool area was good, I was actually surprised how busy it was. The only thing that slightly ruined it was the lifeguards (4 of them) who were over zealous to say the least. I was not allowed to put my son on my shoulders when in the pool and was told off for drinking my coffee to near the pool. The food in the hotel was good, we were on the DDP which was worth at least $140 per day for us. We used the Mara most days for breakfast which had a good selection of pastries, cereals, fruit etc. Buy one of their coffee cups when you get their and you'll get free tea/ coffee/ juice every day. We had lunch as well there a few times which was good. Don't bother with Boma its either a waste of a table service credit or expensive, $60 for cereal, toast, coffee etc. However it was very nice for dinner I am not usually a big fan of buffets but this was one of the best I have eaten at. The transportation to the parks was really good. Regular buses to take you to all the parks in less than 20mins. The only issues I had were when people in the motorized scooters went to the front of the queue with their whole family, then took up half the bus. No issue at all with disabled people getting priority but the number of people who went onto the bus on these scooters then got up and out of the scooter to take up another seat was quite frustating. The other thing was when on a busy bus home from a park, I had a few occasions where I had to stand with my son who was tired and wanting to sleep, while grown adults sat there watching you struggle. A general lack of manners. Overall the holiday was amazing and I would recommend this hotel especially those staying with staying with young kids, my son loved seeing the animals every day. I would also recommend getting the Dining Plan as it was great value but make sure you book tables a few days in advance or go for dinner early if you want a table.

We had utilized the online check-in service, so when we arrived (using Disney's Magical Express) at 10:30 a.m., less than 5 minutes later we were on our way down the Zebra Trail to our Savannah view room. Needless to say check-in was a breeze and we didn't have to wait at all even though we were hours ahead of the 3 p.m. Check-in time. Our room itself was on the farthest end of the Zebra Trail hallway and even though I've read other reviews of people complaining how \"far you HAVE to walk\" it literally only took us 3 minutes to walk from our room to the front of the lobby, and then another 2 minutes to get to the buses. I've been in grocery stores that are harder to navigate. It's really not a far walk at all. One tip to make it even less of a walk is to cut through the giftshop instead of going all the way to the lobby. Our room was a standard sized hotel room, nothing fancy except for the balcony overlooking the Savannah. This was a great feature and made it nice to sit out there after a long day in the parks to just relax and watch the animals. We didn't really use the pool at all as it was all that warm, I think the hottest it got was 84 degrees. We did walk the property though, and the pool area looked great. There were two hot tubs situated on either side of the pool, but were packed with families most of the time due to the cooler weather. We were on the dining plan, so we had made reservations to Jiko. The place is gorgeous and the service was excellent. They started us off with moist towels to wipe our hands with, then proceeds with a six course meal that was of great quality. Everything tasted great. I highly recommend this fine-dining experience. We also ate at Mara, which is the quick service location. We had both breakfast and dinner here which is the same food served at similar locations throughout the parks. The bus system was great as usual. This was our third stay on Disney property and we've never had a bad experience with the buses. Although oct 1st was the 40th anniversary of the Magic Kingdom, so those buses were very difficult to come by, so we just went to a different park figuring the Magic Kingdom would be to crowded to deal with anyway. That night there was also a marathon going on, so many buses took longer than expected due to roads being closed, but the resort had informed us of this prior with a note that was left by room service. As far as the time the buses take to get to the parks, Magic Kingdom is the farthest taking a mere 20 minutes from the resort to the bus stop. Epcot is about 15 minutes away, Hollywood Studios 10 minutes or less, and Animal Kingdom clocked in under 5 minutes. One tip when choosing which parks to go to, DON'T pick the parks that have either early or evening extra magic hours. Everyone picks those parks, making them extremely crowded. If you choose 1 of the other two parks, you will find it to be much more relaxed and pleasant. We did this, and every park we visited (with the exception of Epcot during the Food and Wine Festival) was tactically empty. 10 minute waits on the majority of rides except for Toy Story Mania, which we just got fast passes for. All in all, it's an excellent place to stay, friendly staff, top-notch room service, etc. Having stayed at other Disney Properties, however, this is the same service you get anywhere from Disney. The only difference here is that all the rooms are in one building instead of several buildings, the decor is breathtaking, and the view of the savannah is unmatched. If these things are important to you, then you may find great value in the price. For us, however, it's literally half the price to stay at a value resort and have nearly the same experience saving us over $2000. Even if you don't stay here though, get reservations for Jiko!", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford CT", "Title": "\u201cOk but not my favorite Disney Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DVCmemberHartfordCT", "ReviewID": "UR119057827", "Content": "First, I am a frequent Disney visitor and have stayed at just about every hotel - I will not be returning to this one.

Also, we went Club Level, which was also totally worth it. Not much extra a night if you're already going for one of the savannah view rooms, and you get access to a 'secret snack floor' with food and drinks available pretty much all day (includes beer and wine and even spirits at night). We found this to be great as you're often on the run all the time with fitting things in at Disney and it was great to just go grab a coke or some pretzels. The 5-7 cheese and crackers, and appetisers from one of the restaurants were a highlight - great if you're heading out for a late-night sesh at one of the parks (because you get extra hours when staying at a Disney Resort). Also the staff are super helpful on the club level floor and will get/tell you anything you need. The lobby is really impressive and spacious, but this hotel is big, and some rooms would have been a fair walk from the entrance - however these rooms generally have the best views so that's the trade-off. The pool looked nice, spent a couple of hours out there. Looked like there were a lot of activities going on for kids to keep them entertained. We had a meal at the fancy restaurant (name escapes me), and it was amazing, couldn't fault it. Fairly pricey but food was that good it was worth it! The only negative I would say it that there is no wireless internet available which we thought was strange since it's common to have it at most hotels of this standard. We could walk to the sister resort (about 10-15 mins walk) and use theirs but they still wanted to charge us about $20 a day for it. Personally I think this is terrible considering the high prices you already pay to stay at a Disney Resort (and even at club level???).

This was our second visit having stayed here in November 2010. We love this hotel. When we drove through the gates it actually felt like we had never been away. All the staff that we met were very friendly and chatted away to us and made a fuss of our 3 year old daughter. Last time we stayed in a Pool View room, where we could hardly see the pool. This time round we opted for a standard room and were allocated one on the Zebra Trail (2572). Our view this time was much better and we often woke to giraffes, zebras or antelope outside our window. The room was ok, but we didn't go to Disney to spend a lot of time in the room. Our only minor issue we had was that the queen beds were quite high up and could not be moved, and we were concerned that our daughter (who is a restless sleeper) would fall out. Each night we packed the space between the bed and the wall with our suitcases to prevent her falling out of bed and injuring herself. We ate at Mara few time and the food was reasonable, although I think you would get bored of the limited choices quite quickly. We ate at Jiko one night and although the food was good we were very disappointed with the service. Our reservation was for 7.55pm. We were finally seated at 8.25. We did not order starters and our main course was on the table at 9.25. It's very difficult to keep a hungry three year old occupied for an hour and a half. There was no explanation or apologies from the waiting staff for this delay. A few of the reviews mention the transportation time to and from the parks. We did not think that they were too bad, however I did end up standing with the stroller on many of the journeys. We had two issues with the transportation. The first relates to the motorised scooters who swanned to the front of the queue, up onto the bus and then the \"driver\" got off the scooter and walked to another seat closely followed by their family. This often took up about a quarter of the bus, thus limiting the seating for those legitmately in the queue. The second issue relates to the rudeness of some guests onboard the buses. In many instances, on the busy bus, there would be adults holding onto young tired / sleeping children who were forced to stand for the journey, whilst able bodied visitors occupied seats. A common courtesy would be allow those with young chilldren to sit, but often this never happened. I gave up my seat on most journeys to allow other mothers / fathers with young children to sit down. I believe I was in the minority.

But consider elsewhere if you're a couple wanting more than just savanna views...\u201d", "Author": "ianrob84", "ReviewID": "UR118963222", "Content": "On our most recent trip to Walt Disney World in September 2011, we decided that we would split our 8 day break into two pieces, spending two nights at the tail end of our holiday at Disney\u2019s Bay Lake Tower, (where we own as part of the Disney Vacation Club), and six nights at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, Jambo House, (the older part of resort, Kidani Village is the latest edition). As we are DVC members, we stayed in an Animal Kingdom Villa on the 5th floor of the hotel. Our room was off the Kudo Trail and overlooked the Sunset Savanna, directly across from the atrium of Kidani Village foyer. We chose to only have a studio room, so that we could make the most of our points and to afford us a couple of nights at Bay Lake Tower. We chose AKL, as we had previously visited the resort on our last vacation, having dinner at Jiko. We felt the grand, Africana ambiance of the hotel was such, that we decided it would make a great vacation hotel. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t disappointed! If you\u2019ve not been to the Animal Kingdom Lodge, it\u2019s worth a trip \u2013 steeped with architectural influences of the African Continent, the majestic building is constructed to look like it is made of a sturdy log-frame, topped with a hay thatch roof. The d\u00e9cor is rich in colour and texture, with comfortable winged armchairs and sofas littering the grand hotel foyer, complimented by a large open fire which burns all day and adds to the variety of delicious smells that emanate from Jiko and Boma restaurants on the lower levels. At the far end of the vast lobby with its high, vaulted ceiling, is a full length glass wall, with views out towards the well-designed pool complex. The Uzima Springs pool is over 11,000 square feet. It is also has an entrance without steps and a rather large slide which looked very popular with kids! There isn\u2019t though a quiet pool, so adults, be warned! The pool is open 24 hours a day but is only manned until 10:00 PM, which is when the slide closes. The two spas close at midnight \u2013 we didn\u2019t admittedly use the pool this time, but it\u2019s certainly one of the best at Walt Disney World. The lobby has a large floor plan for the main level, with the well-stocked Zawadi Marketplace, selling everything from authentic African souvenirs and the usual Disney merchandise to beers, cereals and emergency medicines! To the right of the lobby is a series of multi level areas, entwined around a majestic waterfall, which ultimate lead down to the lower levels with restaurants and access to outside areas of the hotel. The check-in process was quick and painless as always. We chose not to check-in online before arrival, but nonetheless it was a smooth process. The only downside being that we couldn\u2019t collect our park passes, (or have them directly linked to our room keys as on previous vacations), as we had purchased them separately from the Walt Disney World UK website and the two systems were not compatible. This did annoy us somewhat, but it would be unfair to criticise the hotel on this, as it was more of a WDW system problem and not AKL itself. After check-in, we made our way to our room. Our initial reaction was wonderful. The room\u2019s design, compliments the rest of the hotel perfectly, with the same rich colours and textures, being carried into the d\u00e9cor and furnishings. You almost feel as though you are transported into a romantic African film set, and as you make your way through the room, the view of the Sunset Savanna peaks through the drapes. Upon pulling these back, the vast Savanna, which would be the envy of many safari parks and zoo\u2019s across the world, opens up to you. In true Disney style, guests are made to feel as though they are \u201con-stage\u201d, this time transported into another era, of desert plains and tropical oasis. Cleverly designed so that guests feel as though the rooms lead directly onto the Savanna, over looking animals such as giraffe, zebra, ostrich, to name but a few. Thankfully, a species guide is given in each room, so kids young and old can try to spot them all \u2013 it certainly is a wonderful sight to see and as far as we could tell \u2013 no animal smells! Cast members regularly clear up after animals, so it never posed a problem. At night, the savanna is lit up with artificial moonlight to help the animals feel adjusted \u2013 the key thing that anybody could easily pick up on at Jambo House, was that animals are very well respected and look after. It\u2019s worth mentioning here that AKL is a smoke free resort \u2013 guests are asked to smoke only in designated areas \u2013 smoking on the balconies is strictly prohibited as with all Disney Resort Hotels, but at Animal Kingdom, this point is even more heavily laboured \u2013 discarded cigarette butts, as well as any other type of litter, pose a danger to animals. Management make it quite clear that anybody found to be abusing this will be asked to leave the resort, and quite rightly so in my book! It is Animal Kingdom, after all! Having said that, inevitably accidents will happen and the cast members will gladly retrieve any items that may fall from the balcony, as there is no access to ground floor level to guests on the Savanna areas of the resort. The room itself was just lovely. The bed was extremely comfortable, although ours did squeak at the slightest of movements! The room furnishings also include a decent sized wardrobe, a small dining table with two chairs and a comfortable sofa bed with coffee table. All help to continue the heavy theming and the imagination working! The room also houses a small kitchenette, with microwave and coffee machine. If you\u2019re a true brit like me, you\u2019ll need your morning cup of tea, and whilst we took our own travel kettle, documentation does say that a kettle can be provided if asked for at concierge, (limited availability). The room also has a vanity area with twin sinks and ample storage space for toiletries. A separate bathroom hosts a toilet with shower over bath \u2013 the shower was brilliant! Great pressure and hot water all-day every day\u2026 No cold showers here! We had a couple of minor problems with the room \u2013 as mentioned, the bed squeaked even if you looked at it the wrong way, one of the lights failed in the vanity area and the coffee machine stopped working. We went to concierge and informed the cast members \u2013 unfortunately, nothing was done about the problems the first day we reported it. I can\u2019t help but think the cast member we spoke to was still \u201cearning her ears\u201d !! However, we reported the issues again the following day \u2013 after a very apologetic response, we returned home after a day in the parks to all problems having been rectified, so we were happily satisfied. Whilst the magic and feeling of the Animal Kingdom Lodge, are enough to wow even the most Disney-sceptic of people, we did find that as a 30-something couple with no kids, that perhaps AKL wasn\u2019t quite suited for our needs. Due to the nature of Animal Kingdom, it needs to be away from the noise and fireworks of the other parks, which is perfectly understandable, but it subsequently means that it\u2019s furthest away from everything else. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s absolutely miles away, but don\u2019t be surprised if a bus back from say Magic Kingdom, takes 30 minutes, especially when the park is busy \u2013 you might not even get on the first bus! This may not be ideal after a hot, sticky and tiring day wandering around the parks and all you want to do is get back and lie horizontal in your comfortable bed! We\u2019re not naive though and understand that a Disney holiday is a drain on the feet & legs, and yes of course, you can happily drive between the resorts and park for free, I\u2019m sure this suits families well! However, as we were a young couple on holiday, it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to expect one of us to not be able to have a drink with dinner or whilst strolling around Epcot. We found that on occasion, the journey back to the hotel was a little tedious on the busses. That being said, AKL has dedicated bus services, which only stops at Jambo House and Kidani Village, unlike most of the other resorts, which may well have 2 or 3 resorts as stops on the way between areas within Walt Disney World. We personally thought that other resorts, such as the Boardwalk Resort Area, with its access to Epcot through International Gateway and boat transportation or footpath through to Hollywood Studios, plus the bars and restaurants of the Boardwalk itself, or the Magic Kingdom Resorts with on-foot access, (especially from BLT and the Contemporary) or greater transport access with the monorail, busses and the Ticket and Transportation Centre, would be more suited to us in future, as access to some of the parks is easier and more accessible. Do not expect to go to Animal Kingdom Lodge and be able to get anywhere, not even Animal Kingdom Park, on foot \u2013 it simply isn\u2019t do-able! All in all though, Animal Kingdom Lodge is a truly wonderful hotel, a jewel in Disney\u2019s collection. And whilst I believe it\u2019s certainly more geared towards families with kids, I don\u2019t think there is anyone who would stay here, who wouldn\u2019t feel like they were young again \u2013 the imagination cannot fail to be stimulated!

We had club level at Jambo House. The resort has a dark appearance to it, our room was small with dark furniture and this was just depressing :( Breakfast was repetitive, boring and not tempting enough for us to make it before 1030 am each day. Cereal, bagels (not very good ones), muffins/chocolate pastry and oatmeal. They didn't change it up. Somedays we waited until 11am for quick service lunch.

Ok, I'm basing this review on our first stay last year at Beach Club, Club Level. The resort was bright, colorful and the rooms were large. I'm a shellfish lover and the Cape May clam bake was awesome! And, ahhhh..... the Beach Club sand bottom swimming pool!!! Should I say more? And then there's the pool bar!!! Ok, I need to stop reminiscing. Next paragraph... This time we wanted give Animal Kingdom Lodge a try especially since it was about $600+ cheaper than Beach Club. We now realize you get what you pay for. We did have the Savannah View at Animal Kingdom...very nice!!! We saw giraffes, zebras, wilder beasts, antelope, cattle and different types of birds. On days when we had down time was somewhat depressing because we didn't want to hang out in our small, dark room. During the day it was too hot to sit outside and the animals were nowhere in sight (cause it was too hot)! The resort wasn't big enough to explore and the pool was just OK. However, the water slide in Kidani village was awesome! Prepare yourself for hundreds of annoying flying bugs to attack you there while you're lounging!!!! You're better off at Jambo pool (less bugs). No bugs at the Beach Club pool and the resort is close to Epcot, the boardwalk, Hollywood Studios and other attractions. I will say that Simba's Cub House at Animal Kingdom Lodge was wonderful for our 5 year old. She spent a few hours there and loved it!!! So did we \u00dc The food at Boma's and Mara's was really tasty! We really appreciated the different spices and selections. Don't expect shellfish because you won't get it there! Very disappointing.

We had a pool view room and were on the dining plan. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Upon arriving (via car), we drive up to the huge reception area and were greeted by the valet and bell service. This was a bit hectic as the second we step out of the car, they immediately separated me and my husband by having him stay with the car while they unloaded and sent me and my son inside to check-in. I was wanting to wait until the luggage was unloaded so my husband could watch my son while i checked in. Rather, my son was running in between my feet while I stood to check-in at the reception desk. They pretty much pushed me inside the doors and I felt as though I didnt really have a choice to wait for my husband. That was the start of the trip. By the time we caught up with each other, and were actually in our room, both me and my husband were pretty stressed out. He mentioned the valet and bell service worker he encountered was extremely rude to him, even though he tipped him well. This wasn't the only rude cast member we encountered during the week. We had a few others, but chalked it up to maybe they were having a bad day? So, we started off a little overwhelmed. But, the actual lodge itself, decorations and theme, were quite impressive. In fact, walking into the lobby was breathtaking. Had we not encountered the stressful arrival that we did, I porbably would have had a little bit more time to take it all in. Our room was great! We had two queen beds and a pool view. We thought the size was perfect for our family of 3. We had plenty of drawer and closet space to put all of our belongings. The beds were comfortable as well. Air conditioning worked great. We were able to view animals at all the animal overlooks and saw animals almost every time we went to view them. One negative about the resort we had would be the proximity our room was to the daily pool party. Yes we had a pool view room, but every day from 1pm-4pm, there is a pool party going on---- a loud pool party. Our room must have been right next to a speaker because when we were trying to get in an afternoon nap, our beds were vibrating to the beat of the music. It was that loud! With a preschooler, it was tough to get him down for a good nap without him waking up every now and then due to the loud music. We use a sound machine while we sleep and had it up pretty loud, but didn't help drown out the music or noise. The pool area was fabulous, though! Although, if you don't grab a chair by 10am, it might be hard to find multiple chairs next to each other. We just wanted two chairs and had a hard time finding two side-by-side by 11am. We saw several families saving 5-7 chairs at a time with the white hotel towels and never return to their chairs for hours (2+) at a time. Saving chairs is fine if you are going to use them between going from the pool to the chairs, but please be courteous and actually USE the chairs. If not, please remove your towels so other families can have some place to actually sit besides the concrete. Thank you. Our experience in Disney World was awesome!! We had such an amazing time! We were able to visit every park and enjoyed them all in different ways. The travel books say that September is one of the best times to go as far as crowds go, but we encountered a lot of crowds each day at every park. My touring app would give parks a 2.5 or 3 on the crowd level and I found that to be a bit off as the walkways in some of the parks were very hard to maneuver through with the loads of people squished into them. Ride wait times weren't as bad, though, with waits anywhere from 15-25 minutes except for Toy Story which was up to an hour. We were able to make rope drop EVERY DAY of our trip and rode all of our \"must-do's\" within the first two hours of park opening, but by the afternoon it was packed, so we headed back to the hotel for a nap. I would highly recommend making at least one day of rope drop. Well worth your time!! We just made sure to be back in the room by our son's normal bedtime, if not before and didn't find it hard to get up that early. Another negative about the hotel, in particular: It is about a 20-25 minute, sometimes 30 minute, drive to Magic Kingdom on the bus or by car. If this is the park you will spend most of your time, spend the extra money for one of the monorail resorts. Although we loved the hotel and the area that it was in as well as the proximity to the Animal Kingdom Park, we spent several days at MK and felt a lot of our time was spent traveling back and forth--difficult to do when you have an exhausted preschooler. Hotel Restaurants---FABULOUS!! We ate at Boma twice for dinner and twice for breakfast and thought it was awesome! We were on the dining plan. We ate a Mara twice and thought it as well as a great quick service spot. Didn't eat at Jiko; maybe next time. However, our favorite restaurant the entire trip was hands down, Ohana! Make reservations for this place well in advance! You will be glad that you woke up at 6am 180 days before your trip---TRUST ME! Other than those few negatives: proximity to MK, the pool party noise in the pool view room, and the chaotic check-in with the rude bell service worker, our stay was great!! We would highly recommend this resort. TIP: either splurge on the savanna view room or save your money and get a view of the parking lot-- especially if you have a small child who needs a nap.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing breakfasts\u201d", "Author": "LastMinuteLulu", "ReviewID": "UR118852002", "Content": "Stayed in an Arusha view room with two double beds. Size was fairly standard. We didn't find it overly small and it was more than adequate for 3 nights for 2 adults and 1 child. Room was bright enough and not at all dark as some reviews suggested. Room was on same floor as and just to right of reception so a little noisy with lots of people heading back and forth but nothing too disturbing - would recommend further along the same corridor. We found being on the lower floor good for seeing the animals. Dawn and dusk are definitely the best times to spot them. Disney's magical express was an absolute boon when arriving fairly late in the evening. I booked this direct on the website and we were on their transport lists when we arrived despite the 42 days notice the website suggested and no email confirmation. Bought park tickets at reception, but would have been cheaper from the UK. If you do buy from reception, I'd recommend not buying the park hopper unless you are certain you will use it - you can pay the top up on the day if you decide to park-hop. Public areas of hotel are stunning - huge double height central atrium with a fire, beautiful carvings and disney on TV for the kids. Great bus services to and from the parks makes life very easy. We ate breakfast in Boma every morning (about $60 / day + tips for the 3 us). You need to book! It was fantastic, they roasted ham, tomatoes and asparagus over a wood fire and the flavour was to die for! There were huge bows of fresh pineapple, strawberries and other fruit as well as the usual buffet selection of almost everything you can think of. We never tried the nicer restaurants for dinner at the end of a long day in the parks and instead opted for the quick service Mara restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised with this, serving tasty simple food like roast chicken with couscous and african stew and you could still get a bottle of wine with dinner (albeit with disposal plastic glasses).

We used our Disney vacation club points and got a two bedroom savanah view. Unfortunately we were so busy that we only enjoyed the animals from our balcony a few times. There are large windows everywhere in the hotel so as you walk pass the lobbey, you see different animals outside eating and just hanging. There are view points that you can go to enjoy the views so may not be worth to have a savanah view. The hotel is amazingly decorated and so clean. The staff were all friendly and everyone was either greeting you or helping you. Kadani is the smaller and quieter side compared to Jambo house. That place is nice too but what a zoo. Jambo house is nicely located with all the restaurants, bigger gift shop, and bigger pool. The hotel shuttle transfers guests from the two villages every 5 minutes so not a big deal to us. It is not far to walk but with two little kids and hot humidity heat, the van ride is nicer. The disney express buses stop by Kadani first to pick up passengers but drops off at Jambo house first. So we always had a seat on the bus taking the ride from kadani but not so if you wait to get on the bus from Jambo house. The pool at Kadani has a nice water park for kids. The main pool has two slides (one small one and one big one). The larger pool at Jambo is very nice with a fun medium sized slide that even my two year old can enjoy. The pool games were great for kids and adults and we can even win prizes. The rooms were very nice and the master's has a king size bed and a larger bathroom with whirlpool jets in the tub. The large shower is nice also. The single chair in living room folds out a twin size bed and the sofa converts to queen size bed. There is also a third full bathroom in Kadani villas but not at Jambo. The rooms are clean and plenty of amenities. We ordered groceries beforehand and they delivered the day we got there and put all the stuff away for us which tells you the level of service disney promotes. We went to every park and waterpark also. We used the disney buses for all our transfers and they are 90% of the time prompt. Once again, certain times it is so crowded on the bus that it is literally a sardine can. The restaurants are excellent. We went to Sanaa and Boma both very unique and tasty foods. Did not go to jinko b/c so expensive. Mara provides all kinds of snacks and quick meals and we never have trouble getting tables. We bought a disney mug that has unlimited refills on soda and coffee for $15. My husband drinks alot of soda so it is worth for us although you can not refill it at any of the parks and waterparks. Only at the resorts. Everyone knows about the disney parks so I'm not going to go over them. Waterparks are the best I've ever seen. So much fun for all ages. Downtown disney is full of life especially at night. You can't go wrong visiting there at night. There are a ton of people, musics, performers, shops, and excellent restaurants, how can you go wrong? Make sure everyone is well hydrated and strollers are a must for those with kids (even if they are in grade school). It is a huge place and lots of walking back and forth required. Alot of rides for little ones but 40inch seems to be the requirement for more thrilled rides. Just mix the rides with the shows so you can find rest and air conditioning in b/w the lines and the heat. It rained everyday we were there but unlike 4 years ago, the rain poured hard and lasted sometimes hours instead of minutes. We used ponchos but it rained so hard that the streets were flooded in minutes so umbrella seemed like a better idea.

We were upgraded to a Savannah view room from a pool view room, which was a very nice surprise. We had a 2 queens room (we requested a king) but no kings were available. There have never been kings available on any of our stays, so if this is something you really want I would plan on it being unavailable here. The common areas of this hotel are just breathtaking--so scenic and comfortable, with amazing details everywhere. The common areas here deserve top marks by any standard. They set a wonderful mood and the hotel feels like a retreat (albeit a very large one). It does tend to be darker everywhere, which is part of the mood and pleasant in my opinion, but if you want a very bright hotel, this isn't it. Once in the room, the hotel does not impress so much. While the room looks nice, it is VERY small. There is hardly any room between the 2 queens and the walls, and only a small space in between the beds. On the end where the TV armoire is, there is just enough room to open the drawers. There is also 2 chairs at a table, and they are just wedged in there, giving one chair enough room for an adult (hitting the wall in the back), but the other is so close to the table it is really only a kid-sized space. Everything is a very tight fit, with very little room for suitcases. It is darker in there as well, but we didn't mind that. (If the shower room was a little brighter that would be better though, I'll bet it's only a 25w bulb in there). We found the beds to be in need of replacement. Mine was collapsing in the middle on the edge and somewhat squeaky, and the other one was profoundly squeaky. My back was not happy in the morning. For being in a quiet part of the hotel, there were many noises to wake you up. The main problem stemming from the very thin walls. I heard the snoring person next door, them brushing their teeth, flushing the toilet, tv, and talking. They seemed like pretty quiet folks, but the walls were just so thin. Much more so than other hotels, and also just the (as expected) hallway traffic noise. The toilet flush is really loud and would wake people up in our own room as well. If you get unlucky and get neighbors while are moderately noisy--don't expect any sleep while they are up! Housekeeping seemed to consist of a quick wipe down of the sink, empty the trash cans, and make up the beds. The only change the sheets on your fifth day, unless you request it. We had a towel animal the first day, but not after, even with tips. The Savannah view on the Zebra trails was pleasant--there were a variety of animals at different times of the day (no zebras that we saw though, how funny). It is not a very long walk/elevator ride on this trail to the lobby, pool, or food court, it is a very convenient spot if you are hoping to minimize what could be lots of walking at this hotel. The food court is nice in our opinion, but not a ton of hot meal selection. The cheeseburger and zebra domes was the only things we got more than once, so would be the most recommended. Lots of grab and go and fruit-bowl kinds of options, including a gluten and dairy free brownie and soy regular and chocolate milk boxes. The staff is helpful and very good with making a meal to meet allergies. This is a great food court if someone has food restrictions and needs a helpful chef who will make something to meet dietary restrictions. This hotel always had longer times on the bus due to its location, but direct service sort of made up for that. Now this bus makes 2 stops though, at Jambo House and Kidani village, and it really does increase the time and the probability you will stand on the bus ride. I am not sure if we will stay here again due to the room size and noisiness, and the increased travel time on the buses, but the common areas and allergen-friendly food court do tip the scales in this hotel's favor.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest USA", "Title": "\u201cVery Good but not quite Excellent!\u201d", "Author": "China101", "ReviewID": "UR118589126", "Content": "We stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge for 5 nights. We LOVED our first impression of the hotel. We were warmly greeted, given a mini-tour and escorted to the front desk for check-in. We had a pool-view room as we wanted to be close to the pool and restaurants and we were very close. Our room had a somewhat musty smell. I assume it is because of the humidity in Florida. The room, as others have noted, was somewhat small but clean and well laid-out with a decent amount of storage for clothing, etc. The pool was great for our 4-year-old as there was a zero-depth section to the pool and a great waterslide. There were also numerous lifeguards staffing the pool so it made it a bit easier to relax as our daughter swam in the pool with her life jacket. We were, however, a bit disappointed that the only poolside food service is by ordering room service with delivery outside to the pool area. This resort is absolutely beautiful and there is a full schedule of events and activities to do daily. There are a number of African-themed events as well as campfires, movies outside at night and pool parties and games. There is enough going on that you really wouldn't have to leave the hotel. The reason I have this 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because the staff, especially the concierge staff, were not particularly knowledgeable nor were they very friendly. Often, they were checking people in and those of us who had a \"concierge\" question would have to wait a significant amount of time in order to get our question answer. Plus, a number of the answers were incorrect (park closing hours; how to get to the mickey's backyard bbq and hoop-de-doo music revue). We also were stuck with concierge trainees a number of time who didn't know the answers to questions but had to answer because their trainer said the trainee must answer. This was a huge waste of our time and it wasn't at all very guest-focused. Finally, we mentioned our 4-year-olds birthday to a number of staff (including concierge) at this resort. We did not receive anything to commemorate the big event - not a card from the characters, not a call to say happy bd, not a cupcake. We were told, upon check-in, that if we wanted a cake we could call and order one (for $24 of course!). I was somewhat disappointed that Disney could not have done SOMETHING - we received more from the waiters at the various restaurants we ate at during the week. Finally, we did soon realize that the people working valet were much more helpful than the concierge staff and we relied on them for directions and advice on transportation within the disney system.

The first thing to remark about is the layout of the room. Not only are the two bedroom areas separated by the living room, but there is an EXTRA full bathroom near the entryway that made getting ready with four girls a breeze. (That makes three full bathrooms in total). The toilets are all separate from the sinks and showers for multi-person use. There is just so much SPACE, which was perfect for my 14-month old after a long day at Disney in the stroller. The beds were a bit on the hard side but comfortable enough, and even the pull-out couch bed wasn't terrible. The kitchen was stocked as usual for DVC, I appreciate the paper towels and dish soap a lot! The only thing missing in the kitchen was counter space to put any groceries, there wasn't an open cupboard either, so we had to do some rearranging of dishes to accommodate. I didn't mind but I'm not sure how housekeeping felt. The savanna was fairly populated any time of the day, and the balcony was generous and quite long as it spanned all three rooms. I love the Mara quick service, it really is a lot better than most quick service options at Disney. My son and I have a severe dairy allergy and as with all Disney restaurants, the chefs have always been very helpful. Boma is a great buffet if not expensive ($35 a person, $14 for children starting at age 3). It has a good variety and is similar to the Tusker House. Try the curry chicken stew and peanut rice. Mmm. The only two 'complaints' I have are somewhat minor. First, the rooms are decorated very nicely, with African themed furnishings. The appliances and lighting are all energy-efficient, with motion-sensor lights in the bathroom. Other than that, though, the lighting is all provided via lamps, no overhead lights. This made for quite a dark room no matter if the windows were open or not, during the day. It was a bit of an annoyance, honestly, but if you don't spend much time there during the day it wouldn't much matter. The other complaint I have is regarding the parking for Kidani Village. It is a above-ground parking structure with a weird one-way flow, and only one elevator per 'area' (Timon, Pumbaa, etc.). The parking here was sparse when I was visiting, even though it wasn't peak season, so we were forced to park quite far from our area's elevator and take all our luggage in, because we didn't want to wait for the bellboy (it is not staffed 24/7, they have to call someone down which we thought would take longer than going ourselves. Wrong). I only found parking near our elevator once, and we even were traveling with someone who had a handicap placard. Overall, it was a great stay full of wonderful amenities and activities.

The room smelled clean and was very comfortable and quiet. We finally felt truly \"at home\", just like we remember it from last year. We had a nice view of the animals throughout the day. The kids were excited about the bunk bed and kept themselves entertained climbing up and down. There are a few Disney channels on tv that play family appropriate shows. The rooms are quite small, but we found them adequate for our needs. If you are traveling with a small child you might want to know that there is a pack-n-play in every room that can be used. The toilet does have a strong flush, but I have to say that the doors are doing a good job at dampening noise, and we really didn't hear much noise from our neighbors next door. The room was very quiet at all times. The bathroom was ok. It's on the small size (toilet and tub/shower combo), like some reviewers mentioned, but that didn't bother us. The vanity area with two sinks opens up to the \"corridor\" right by the entrance and is a good size. We are a family on a budget, so we decided to splurge on this hotel instead of going to the parks, and opted for activities around the hotel and swimming in the pool at the lodge and the nearby Kidani village (great pool and splash zone that seemed less crowded than the pool at the AKL). For our young children this was enough excitement and helped us adults really relax and unwind. We did go to Downtown Disney one morning and had the kids play at the Lego store, ride the carousel and visit the Disney store for some shopping. There are numerous activities offered for kids and adults at the Lodge (Jambo House. We did the \"bead\" activities this year. At the end of each session, the participants receive beads that form a nice memento from the stay. I found the activities to be fun and educational, and the kids loved them. (One of them involved preparing treats for the animals and later watching the animals enjoy them - big hit with the kiddos). The hotel seems very busy, but we still had no problems with finding relaxing spots that offered a tranquil atmosphere. My favorite is the Sunset Lounge right off the lobby. We love the BOMA restaurant for breakfast and dinner (food is very good). I really think that it's one of the better buffets at Disney. The hosts and waiters are friendly and don't fail to deliver. We dined at the Fort Wilderness restaurant on the night of my daughter's birthday, and nobody ever acknowledged the fact despite me mentioning it several times to the staff at the time of reservation and at the restaurant itself. The following night at BOMA, I mentioned it briefly to the hostess as we were being seated. At the end of our meal, our server brought out a cupcake with a candle and we got to sing Happy Birthday for my daughter. It made our night. The MARA was just another quick serve place and after eating breakfast there, I would prefer BOMA over MARA every day. The price difference was not that significant compared to the quality of food at BOMA. Overall, our stay this year was another great experience. We were able to really relax and get away from our daily routine.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, likely wouldn't go back.\u201d", "Author": "nyc2some", "ReviewID": "UR118375581", "Content": "We stayed for four nights starting Sept 14th.

This Resort is one of the newest, cleanest and best resorts within Disney World Florida and is the main hotel for the Animal Kingdom Theme Park (some 5 Min's around the corner by bus / coach). Granted, this hotel is one of the more expensive hotels, however, if you have the money I would go as far to say it will be worth every penny or cent that you pay extra. From the moment we pulled up we were impressed. The main lobby is breath taking as you walk through the main doors. Reception and Concierge are located on the left and you are welcomed almost immediately by a hotel representative. The main lobby is impressive and has an almost black glass style floor which is immaculate. The back entrance of the hotel is served by a huge glass feature which looks out onto a Savannah full of exotic African Animals. There are other viewing area's and platforms located throughout the hotel. We were lucky enough to be allocated a Savannah view room situated immediately next the the Public Sunset Savannah viewing area. The kids were absolutely blown away the moment they opened up the patio doors and were met by a beautiful Giraffe underneath our balcony. This was the moment I realised the extra money was worth paying for the hotel, although we did not pay extra for a Savannah view room lucky enough. In my opinion, Disney will do as much as they can to please and accommodate you so if your not happy with your room, simply ask to change. There are only a handful of rooms with restricted views of bushes and trees surrounding the pool. Some may not mind this as the amount of time you will spend in your room i guess will be minimal. Outside at the rear of the hotel is a campfire area where you can meet and greet some of the Animal handlers and wardens. You can venture around a small viewing walkway surrounded by wooden fence to separate you from the beautiful Animals such as Zebra, Pelicans, Gazelle etc on the Savannah. I would advise to wear mosquito repellent at night times. There are a number of activities put on for children and adults to get involved with like bongo drumming and learning more about the Animals etc. I must admit, we did not really take part too much. The lobby also has a comfortable seating area and a large TV which plays all of the Disney favourite cartoons day and night. There are 3 main hotel restaurants in Jambo house and another in the Kidani Village (Sister hotel adjacent to Jambo). The quick service snack style restaurant is the Maya. This will serve most of your needs and there is a shop and a soda drink fountain for unlimited refills. I would advise paying $14 for a resort mug, as you will be able to fill it up as often as you like, ideal for when your around the pool. The sit down buffet style restaurant is Boma. Not perfect for picky children as it has an African flavour to many dishes but the adults should give it a try. This is the perfect place for breakfast in my opinion though. The third restaurant is the more expensive of the two sit down table service restaurants, and is called Jika. This is worth a visit but a reservation is advisory particularly if you wish to eat later at night. There is a dress code but it is not too strict. Beautiful food and worth the money. There is a fantastic shop within the complex called The Marketplace. This has some basic essentials you might need, but to be honest, who wants to self cater when your in a place like this. The Marketplace is also a pick up point for all of your delivered shopping that you might have bought earlier the day before. Yep, Disney send any shopping you buy, straight to your resort hotel free of charge the next day. This is very handy, providing your not leaving the following day. The Marketplace sells wonderful artifacts and Disney related merchandise and in my opinion was only bettered by the Little Christmas shop in Magic Kingdom and the World of Disney mega store in Downtown. The Uzima pool is fantastic and has a slide for kids. It is served by 4 lifeguards at any one time and provide children's life jackets so Mum's / Mom's and Dad's can relax safe in the knowledge the kids can play in the water without dramas. There is activities during the day around the pool. My son particularly liked the musical statues game. If it rains, games move inside where the Wii comes out to entertain. The pool is open till very late and is flood lit. There is a pool bar also where cocktails and alcohol is available as you would expect, but for soft drinks I would just use the Mara. The Hotel is served by an excellent, complimentary bus / coach transport service which will take you to all of the other Disney World Theme and Water Parks. From these drop off points you are able to transfer to any other resort very easily and everywhere is clearly signed at these bus stops. The Animal Kingdom Lodge residents are restricted to the bus service only but this is not a problem as you will have to wait only a maximum of 20 Min's to get anywhere. Transfers to all of the theme parks, water parks and Disney Downtown are quick and comfortable although they can be crowded at times. The biggest test was after the Magic Kingdom fireworks show, when thousands leave the park at the same time. Where the queues for the Ferry boat and Monorail are lengthy and time consuming, the buses are frequent and we did not wait at all. We even had the benefit of having kind bus wardens on hand to give the kids presents whilst they waited whenever we had to wait at other parks. This helped to make the bus system a pleasant experience for us. The hotel also has a gym and outside jacuzzi. All in all this hotel is clean, comfortable and an absolutely brilliant experience. Whenever you are asked where your staying, and you reply with the Animal Kingdom lodge, people are always impressed.

The service is top-notch, but the rooms are remarkably small for a luxury resort. (You'll get more space at Coronado Springs.) But if your room looks out onto the savannah, you won't mind. Strategically placed balconies - with comfortable rocking chairs - look out over the savannah. You can't guarantee animal sightings (AKL has it's own wildlife, separate from Animal Kingdom's.), but these balconies are a perfect spot to relax on a cool evening. On a previous trip, we went a little crazy and paid for an upgrade to \"Concierge Level\" - which gave us access to a special lounge overlooking the lobby and lots of little extras. If you can afford it, it's a wonderful splurge. Boma, the buffet-style restaurant is okay, but the place for a great meal here is Jiko. It's pricey, but the food is imaginative and delicious. One advantage of staying here: safaris (for an additional fee, of course) onto the lodge's savannah that aren't open to anyone but guests.

We had two connecting standard view rooms (my 4 kids stayed in one room, my husband and I in the other) but woke up to see the giraffes and other animals every morning. I don't think it is worth paying the extra money for a savannah view because there are several viewing areas throughout the hotel, plus like I mentioned above, I saw them from my standard view room. The lobby is stunning with gorgeous mahongy floors you could eat off of. They also had a large TV in the lobby that all the kids in the hotel would gather around to see classic Disney cartoons. We ate at Boma's and Mara's and were satisfied with both. I really appreciate that Boma took us two hours ahead of our reservation. We could only get a 8:05pm reservation online but arrived around 6pm famished from spending all day at the Animal Kingdom. They took us right away. Nice!! The pool was lovely and I really liked the fitness center's steam room. They provide fresh towels at both areas which was great. The only downside is the resort's distance from the Magic Kingdom which can take up to 25 minutes to get to depending on traffic. But the water parks, Hollywood Studios and the Animal Kingdom are 10 minutes away tops. But I would stay here again in a heart beat because waking up to giraffes is an exotic experience that you don't typically get at home. Lastly, I loved the airline check-in that is set up in the lobby. Give them your bags and pick them up at your destination. What a convenience!!! I think it was only for domestic flights though. AKL is a 5-star hotel without the snobbery.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort plus some Disney tips\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoBob2009", "ReviewID": "UR117836996", "Content": "We have stayed 2 times at the Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL) (once in a regular room and this last time in a Disney Vacation Club or DVC room in Jambo House). The last time was just this July 2011 and what a great stay. It is a wonderful hotel with a cool theme. The grand lobby, halls, restaurants and rooms have a great African detailed theme design. It is so exciting to wake up in the morning and pull back the drapes to see some wild animals hanging out in front of your balcony. I think this would be fun for all ages--I know us adults loved it. We have had great luck paying for just a \"standard view\" but being placed on the edge of the savanna to see the animals as they go to hang out under trees or to be feed by the cast members. If you want a quiet room, I would suggest not taking a \"pool\" view as the pool is very nice and is also very lively. I think the rooms are well appointed. The bathroom is small and a little dark with only one light source but not a problem. With a DVC room we had a small \"kitchenette\" area which was very nice to store snacks and cold drinks. Here are some general tips to make your Disney trip the best it can be: 1. Get up early and get to the parks. You can do so much in the first hour before other guests arrive. 2. Use the Fast Pass system. As soon as your first Fast Pass time starts make sure to send someone in the group to get another one. 3. Before you go plan your days in advance (which parks on which days) and make reservations in advance for sit down meals at each resort. This can save you a lot of time and give you a nice break. People get crabby when they get hungry. 4. Take a break in the middle of the day. If you are hopping then go to a different park at night. You will get more out of the park early in the day and late at night. 5. Book a character meal (like Tusker House @ AK or Crystal Palace @ MK) you'll get a great meal plus wonderful photo memories with up close interactions with the characters. I have seen many kids and adults light up when we go to these places and then again when they share the stories with family and friends after getting home.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!!!!\u201d", "Author": "debbie g", "ReviewID": "UR117790311", "Content": "Have just returned from a 2 week Stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge Jambo House, Hotel was amazing, rooms were ok, Disney dinning plan was amazing value for money.

The staff of the AKL were exceptional in helping us with the many changes and additions we needed to make to our travel plans based on our flight cancellation and the hurricane in our hometown. Waking up each day to giraffes, zebras, ostriches, and other animals is difficult to describe.

(seperate reviews for each, 2 on property, one off with a rental car.) This was week one. Note: We spent a full \"rest day\" at each resort hotel resort in between 2-day park visits. We also had family members join up with us (could only come for the last week) On property definately the better option in saving the parking, gas and transportaion(rental) fees. However, the off property condo (3 bdrm, 4 bath) was a HUGE savings as the group grew and we needed all the extra space. (Disney properties arn't equiped for parties of 5 or larger, except for 3 specific resorts and the price is not worth what you get.) Okay, the AK lodge. Gift shop, transportation reception all good, all fast, all friendly and efficient. The interior is stunning, so well done, comforting and amazing at the same time. The Savanna and outdoor view of animals charming. The music and drums playing all the time was great, and then really annoying, and then we got used to it. Pleased that you can't hear it in the room unless you open the balcony door. We had a Savanna view and opened the door...alot. About the view, look, we came from the West coast and to us it was worth the upgrade. Other reviews complained about the expectations of seeing the animals not being met. Sometimes the animals were there, sometimes not, to us... no big deal, we knew we would catch them another time, and we did) The food is delicious and we ate at every place they have; bar, buffet, cafe, fine dining, concierge lounge, but be prepared for unique flavors. Warning! If you or your children are not into heavily spiced food (not necessarily hot, just a LOT of different and unusual spices), do not stay here, you will not be happy with the food. Instead, stay where the food fits you and come over for a visit, you can resort hop on the free transportation and experience everything the AK has to offer (excluding the rooms) and sample some of the adventureous food, no kidding, there is little else. My son is 10, into all kinds of exotic food, prefers gourmet, but grew tired of the flavors offered after day 2, and did not care at all for the \"kid food\" very bland and average (and pricey by my standards)... he was however always pleased with the free apps offered upstairs (concierge) so he went there. The rooms are small, yes small, every site I read warned me of that so I was not surprised. They are well themed though and we stayed in the concierge upgrade so we spent most of our \"hotel time\" in the upper level lounge, and the regular ammenities; pool and restaurants. Note; we did not stay on the concierge level ($$$) but instead stayed on a lower level and paid the concierge \"upgrade\"($) worth every penny to us as there was free offerings all the time, (breakfast/snacks/appetizers/desserts) including beverages to-go and my favorite...drum roll please... unlimited cappuccino (all day) and evening wine! There are a TON of kids/family activities here, the list changes but includes safari, stories, hide n seek, movies, games, bird watching, art, etc.. a ton more. You get a list of what is available when you check in. Some you sign up for some you just show up for. The Lodge is close to the Animal Kingdom Park and that's it, so prepare accordingly if you are going elsewhere, (not recommended) there will be a stop to the transfer station and extended travel time! Overall I recommend this hotel for it's uniqueness (design, food, merchandise, savanna) and service. Rooms always cleaned, chocolates on pillows, towel animals and delicious food. I do recommend a stay here at least once, it is worth it for 2 nights, 3 days (tops) and visit the AK park, the two are well themed and tied in together so well you'll feel as though you were far far away. I will not stay here again, but will visit it.

We had two interconnecting rooms on the first floor which has great access for the lobby and eating establishments on offer. Boma resturant is a nice place to dine for breakfast/evening dinner but the food is the same and you need to use your 'Disney Dinner Plan' and plan your meals on line before you go as you won't get in at peak periods otherwise. The AKL is beautiful decorated and stunning pictures to be taken, as well as the animals which are second to none. The rooms are clean, the cleaners come in every day and you feel as though Tinkerbell has been in don't forget to leave them a tip well worth it and they do the towels in animal faces such fun for the kids. The staff can't do enought for you and our thanks to a wonderful lady called Nichol who went out of her way to accommodate us and make us have a happy stay. There is a store on site which sells all the basic lines as well as Disney goods at very high prices. Take a taxi or a car drive to the 'Premier Outlet Centre' for the cheaper prices you will have a fun there goods are discounted ones at knock down prices and there is a 'Disney outlet store' on site. The parks were busy but the best time to go is middle of August as the school's go back over there and they are not as manic, a vist to Bush Gardens/ Sea World is a must along with the Kennedy Space Centre but don't forget the bug spray they are out in droves and like us Britts.....This is a Magical Place to stay and by the pool you have the Mara which serves all day breakfast / lunch/tea and the meals are fine along with the sweets, don;t forget if you have kids to get a cup which you can refill at the Hotel as many times as you want not only with juice but with tea/coffee/hot choc so worth the \u00a312.99 each and saves you some monies. There is a laundry facility on site no need to bring it all back with you very cheap $2 a wash and $2 a dryer your soap is a $1 make use of this as it is a gawd send. No need to take towels all provided in the hotel and by the pool the pool is not big but adequate. We found in the August season is is wet and hurricane season so beware Hurricane Irene passed us by this time. If you have tried the other Disney Hotels now try the best one a simply wonderful building and they greet you with ''Welcome Home' everytime you will have every wish you ever dreamed off here and good food to add, but do try Epcot for further dinner venues as it has very taste of the world foods at hand, these are proper eating establishments so remember the' Disney Dinner Plan' you won't go hungry and some tour operators give it free in August. Enjoy your magical stay at this hotel and you won't want to stay anywere else believe me. The negatives only one grumpy reception women called 'Maureen' but you always get one anywere you stay maybe they will move her on ...... we live in hope and anticipation!!! This will be our last stay at AKL as our children have now outgrown the magic and want to go to pastures new, we feel that we have explored this part of the USA fully, teenagers want new places to see !!! but lets not say never again as who knows when we have the AKL calling again.

I expected, as we hadn't paid the extra for a savannah or pool view, we would be overlooking the car park or similar, but we were delighted to arrive in the room (following a walk along a very long corridor!) and find a number of zebras grazing in the savannah outside - phew! Possibly the length of our stay acted in our favour... Waking up every morning to the giraffes, ostriches, zebras, wildebeasts, etc was wonderful - the zebras unique way of communicating through kicking, biting and 'barking' at each other provided no end of entertainment! Hotel was lovely - pool really good, in a beautiful setting, with life-guards supervision and the availability of children's flotation jackets adding to our ability to relax a little more. Food was pretty good too, though we saved an absolute load of money by having the Disney Dining Plan - one table service meal, one 'quick service' meal and one snack a day was perfect for each of us and as it was included in the price of our holiday, even better. If we'd had to pay for the same sort of daily dining ourselves, we reckon it would've added around $3,500 dollars to the cost of the trip. The ability to be able to experience food in a variety of places around the parks was brilliant, especially in World Showcase at Epcot and being able to have an enormous double scoop of Edy's fantastic ice cream, as a snack was fantastic!! The bus service between the hotel and parks was generally good, but there were days when you would wait over half an hour for the bus to your destination, while 3 buses would come to each of the other stops.

This truly unique hotel is one of stunning design and amazing animal savanah views that are magical. But, the rooms are standard, three star accommodations with terrible mattresses, uncomfortable furniture and disappointing, tiny dark bathrooms. The beddding is overly crisp, low end and the pillows hard and unwelcoming. It's not that the rooms don't look nice, it's that they aren't comfortable and feel on the cheap. If you do plan to stay here, make sure you get a savanah view of the animals--and be patient, they roam at their own will and pace. If you can't get, or can't afford a view of the animals -- stay someplace else! There are better choices on property closer to the action. So, should you stay here? If you love animals, embrace the African theme and want a hotel room with a view you can't get anyplace else in the US, then this might be the place for you.

This wasnt really a problem, unless you forgot something and had to return to the room for it! The room was great for our families needs, very clean and tidy, two large comfortable (if a little squeaky) beds and we never tired of the ever changing view from the balcony. All staff we spoke to were helpful, polite and efficient. The pool was great after a long day at the parks, the kids especially liked the film at the pool every night at 9pm. Lots of activities laid of for them during the day too but these were never a nuisance (ie loud and brash) for the adults. The food at the Mara was very good, quite a lot of choice but it did get very busy on occasions although the staff were very efficient and queues were kept to a minimum. We didnt eat at Jiko but had breakfast at Boma. Whilst this was enjoyable I think it was a bit over-rated especially when you took into account the price! Over $100 for a family of four! The zawadi marketplace was very well stocked if a little expensive but was handy for the odd pint of milk or bread that was needed. On the whole, the disney transport was very efficient, we preferred being further away from the parks as it felt very quiet and tranquil around the resort compared to the madness of the parks. Rarely did we have to stand on the buses, only once or twice after staying in the parks for evening extra magic hours. We had a slight problem on our second morning with the toilet leaking (clean water) but maintenance came immediately and fixed the issue straight away. The room was always cleaned to a high standard and special thanks to 'Mabel' our lovely mousekeeping lady who was very friendly and always made a fuss of the kids.

We were two adult friends with two 9 year old kids. This resort is crushingly expensive, and so little in return. The room in Jambo House was very small and poorly designed. There was barely any room to move, let alone stow luggage or unpack clothes. We were all fit and healthy, but felt like we were walking miles in that hotel to get anywhere - assuming we could even find our way through the dark, poorly designed lobby and restaurant areas. Desk staff was appalling - honestly, we've been better treated in a Motel 6. The noise, the yammer - and, yes, a few animals outside. Is that what we are paying for? The animals? We moved from Jambo to Kidani Village after a few days because we were so miserable. The desk staff and concierge at Kidani Village were much better at the customer service aspect, perhaps because the Disney Vacation Club folk go there, and they have more of a voice than the odd tourist at Jambo. As others have commented, AK is far from everything, and shuttle bus service to the parks very uneven. We waited an entire hour on a weekday morning for the Epcot bus, for example, but rarely more than 20-30 minutes otherwise. Our Magic Express shuttle to the airport never arrived (staff just watched us sit there waiting . . .after we had gotten up at 5 a.m. (our flight was at 10:30) just to catch it. OK, yeah, this kind of thing can happen anywhere - but at these prices? Nowhere but Disney. Pool at Jambo was pretty - but shallow and so crowded one could barely move. The pool at Kidani was only a little larger than a motel pool, but had a better water slide. There was no easy access to it - would it have killed the designers to make the pool accessible from the building? You had to walk (a long hot walk) outdoors from the lobby or negotiate a labyrinth parking garage level (sneaking in behind the poolside bar), and this, quite frankly, is ridiculous. Vacation should not be so much hard work, particularly at the end of the day after all that theme-parking. As for the restaurants, Jiko was very, very good, and surprisingly reasonable considering the quality of the food, service and wine, all of which were among the best we'd every had, anywhere. Boma was an overpriced buffet nightmare. Do not get sucked into the breakfast there. Room service breakfast is cheaper than a Boma buffet. Sanaa in Kidani Village was good too - but very small portions, high prices. Mara, the counter service place in Jambo House, was a filthy nightmare with horrific service. Poorly organized and nasty! The lowpoint of our entire vacation was Mara. Room service itself was very efficient and, especially in Kidani, offered a wide and interesting selection of food. There were also tragically overpriced little stores with $3 bananas and such in the lobbies, far, far away. Know that if you go there, you will be disappointed. You will also be woken up by screaming babies and toddlers (walls are very, very thin in Kidani in particular). Do not save up for years for a trip to the AK resort - it's painful when you realize how little it was worth it. You will not be out there much looking at the animals,who come and go, but are mostly far away. If you are paying these kinds of prices, you will want a comfortable room, easy access to the theme parks, service when you need it, and a place to relax. You won't reliably find any of this at AK.

And hot tubs. 5 year old LOVED it. * Good food with unique and tasty African spices. Typicall packed--reserve early. * Challenge: like all Disney \"Luxury\" Resorts, the value for money on the actual room is not good: smallish rooms, cotton/poly sheets, and mediocre amenities. After being out in the bright sun all day, it was nice to return to the cool, dark spacious lobby with soaring ceilings, real African artifacts, and a huge window view out to the Savanna as well. The lobby always had a wonderful smell of some kind of sweet burning wood and interesting African music playing at a low volume. Not an overload of Disney decor at this resort--subtle. Another cool touch was that, on a platform by the Savanna just outside the lobby, guides from various African countries were available to speak with you about any of the animals or discuss their country and traditions. Unique for any hotel in the US and certainly in Disney. The Food in both restaurants was good (and sometimes great) in that most dishes used very well-researched flavorings and spices from Africa. BUT, because this hotel is at least 15-20 minutes away from any other resort by bus (only option)--the 2 restaurants are always booked to capacity. Absolutely RESERVE RESTAURANTS IN ADVANCE. Still, the snack bar is not bad at all and usually has 1-2 OF the aforementioned dishes with tasty spices available (i.e., you're not stuck to pizza and hotdogs). In summary, you can tell ALOT of thought went into the development of this particular resort. It's wonderful and unique! But do not expect much luxury in terms of bedding, room size/layout, decor, or amenities. These are below the grade of a typical big city Hilton or Marriott, even though room rates at Animal Kingdom Lodge (at $450-730) could easily score you a stay in a beautiful room at the Ritz-Carlton facing Central Park in NYC.

The Balcony had a great view of the animals that wandered in for its feeding time. We were on the fifth floor so we had a great view of the animals and also of the great lobby to which it is known for. I will let my photos speak for itself. All of the animal photos were from the lobby and from our room's balcony. Among those seen are Ankole Cattle, Bontebok, Eland, Zebra, Greater Kudu, Impala, Okapi, Red River Hog, Nyala, Reticulated Giraffe, Roan Antelope, Sable Antelope, Thompson's Gazelle, Waterbuck, White-Bearded Wildebeest, Abyssinian Ground Hornbill, Blue Crane, East African Crowned Crane, Greater Flamingo, Marabou Stork, Ostrich, Pink-Backed Pelican, Spur Winged Geese, Guinea Fowl and Ruppel's Griffon Vulture (listed in the pamphlet)! The lobby had chandeliers which I noticed were made out of Shields and Spears if one looks at it closely. We also had a chance to visit the newer Kidani Village to look at more animals (like the Ostrich) and at the hotel itself. There are free shuttles to and from the Jambo House and the Kidani Village. Our Room like the lobby is African inspired right down to the Bed Covers, Cabinets and night lamps. The Bathroom was kept neat and tidy. Our room had a double sink which we loved.

There are also TV Dinners, drinks including African wine selections and sundries are available at the Gift Shop. The Uzima Pool has a zero entry type of pool which is good for the kids. My daughter loved it as it we can stay in it for as long as we like (She swims very well). We never ate at the Jika (fine Dining) But we met up with friends and we did eat at the BOMA which is an african inspired Buffet. I must say BOMA earned a lot of praises from our friends who are true blue foodies - their palates are raving about the flavors!! For those guests with budget in mind. Eat at Mara's which is cheaper and a fast food - take out kind of restaurant. They also offer a $14 disney mug which is refillable(soda and coffee) at anytime of one's stay at the hotel and some parts of the parks and other hotels too. Worth mentioning is the pool and the hot tubs (there are two). The pool has a bar available. The Gym and Spa has good machines on it and worth using although one gets more than enough exercise as one goes to the Parks everyday. Also worth and recommend mentioning is the Magical Express and the airline check in available at the lobby for departing guests. We use the magical express for our airport transfers. Our luggage we checked into Orlando from our departing airport was picked up by the Magical Express and brought to our room directly. We never picked it up at Orlando International. AND When we checked out.... we also checked in our luggage and picked up our Boarding Passes at the counter near the Check in counter of the Hotel. How convenient is that? From this hotel - I was able to print out our Boarding Passes early thereby earning us good seats at our airline carrier.

You feel the intensive heat of the weather and the heat of the busses transportation everywhere. I will love to have a monorail system or other service rather than the busses taking you everywhere. The rooms are quite small for four people I think but it is quite comforting in a way. I loved the balcony and seeing the animals outside my room every day.

Disney is expensive, so getting it right the first time is a must. Originally, we booked tickets via a popular online travel agent but learned that they were selling us a room only guaranteed for two rather than three. So we dumped the reservation and tried again direct with Disney. Disney was not more intelligent. Disney initially tried to charge us extra for our third adult, even though the room comes with a queen and two bunks. Snafus aside, the main building is beautiful. Each restaurant was tasty. Gift shop had nice buys. And of course, rising real early (crack of dawn) to watch the animals wandering out on their treks to wear food is waiting was worth all the trouble. But I wouldn't do it again. A few more bits of information: our room was clearly occupied by kids eating in bed before us and not cleaned by housekeeping; waits were too long for a Disney bus for transportation between theme parks and AKL; the principal reason for coming is to see the animals up close outside your balcony, but that experience is largely an early morning treat (and not so close); the pool area was large with plenty of interest, but it's really just for kids because there isn't a spot to relax without them running about you, including the hot tub; and the bottomless cup beverage service for a mere 8 oz at a time, is in a remote cafeteria that is convenient for the pool but not the rooms or even lobby. My review may seem negative, but I really want to stress that it was fun to do ... once. Advice given to me about choosing one side or the other to see the animals turned out to be good but not deal-breakers. Their advice: Zebra Trail for Arusha view. My advice: get an inexpensive room anywhere where you are facing the animals, and come morning they'll be there outside your balcony.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cKidani Village-OK\u201d", "Author": "KVP2315", "ReviewID": "UR116704424", "Content": "We had a Grand Gathering family vacation here.

There are no quick service restaurants in Kidani so it was a hike to go to Jambo. Kidani is much quieter and cleaner than Jambo. The Kidani pool slide is nicer. The quick service restaurant in Jambo, Mara, was filthy. We had to wipe everything down with sanitizer cloths before we sat down, including the seats.

There was a greeter to greet you once you are off the bus and direct you to front desk depending on if you have done the online check-in. The lobby is gorgeous with huge open 3 story-high ceiling and many comfortable sofas. The room was clean and nicely decorated with the African theme. I called about the squeaky sounds of my mattress when I lay down and get off from the bed second day there. I don't know what they did. It was fixed immediately. My housekeeping lady, Liliana, was a sweet heart. She surprised us every night with different towel animals and a towel birthday cake for one of my boys.

It really was a magical trip because of this. The only complaint I have is our room was not very clean when we arrived and wasn't really cleaned during our stay either. Upon arrival our bathroom mirror had fingerprints of a small child all over it and hair in the bathtub. The only thing that seemed to happen in regards to cleaning was taking out the trash and making our beds. I was a little disappointed in this considering it is a deluxe resort and therefore, should be clean! I found myself cleaning which of course takes time and on vacation, you really don't want to waste valuable time cleaning your hotel room. The only other complaint I have is we found something to be leaking in the bathroom and it smelled like urine. When we would wake up in the morning the grout in the bathroom would be all wet so I'm not sure where it was coming from but hopefully it gets taken care of soon.

I had a view of the roof but I could clearly see the pool area. I didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out on anything because there are plenty of places around the resort to view the animals. If you are planning to tour the parks and be out and about most of the day save your money and just go with the standard view. The Mara is nice but has limited food choices as a quick service venue. I personally still enjoy Pepper Market at Coronado Springs Resort much better. Lobby was beautifully decorated and the rooms were very comfortable. Only things I didn't like was the remote feeling you get when you are at the resort. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your tastes. Also I had a problem with the bus transportation. More so the transportation to EPCOT. Buses to that park seem to run every 30 mins or so.

Our stay was from July 29-August 3 2011 and stayed in the Jambo House with an Arusha Savannah view room. All I can say is WOW. Everything about this hotel is amazing. When we first enter the enormous lobby we were amazed by all the decorations and atmosphere. There is so much to explore in this hotel. Check in was quick and painless. The cast member congratulated us on our wedding and informed us about everything there was at the hotel. He even gave us special pins to wear for our occasion. He took his time to answer all of our questions and wasn't rushing us at all. When we got to our room, we immediately went to the balcony to see if there were any animal. I am happy to report that there were giraffes, zebras, and ankole (Kinda like cows with huge horns). The only reason why I knew the name was because you get a guide with all the animals you can see during your visit. On other days we also saw gazelle, hogs, pelicans, cranes, and many others. There are also these little lizards that are just everywhere it seemed. Not just at the AKL either. I guess these are native to that area in general? I will admit that the animals are not out during all parts of the day. They do go into hiding when it gets really hot but I have seen them during different times. Just don't be disappointed if you don't see anything for a few hours. I knew this going into it so I was not disappointed in the least. I am overall very happy with the amount of time I was able to see the animals. Some even came right under our balcony and we got a really close look. I brought a pair of binoculars which came in handy for the ones that were far away. We had a room for handicap people which was fine. The shower was larger than one the rooms the brides maids were in who also stayed at the AKL. The room was always very clean. We would leave for 30 minutes to eat something at Mara and when we came back, the beds were made and we had fresh towels. The fridge was large enough to store some bottles of water and sodas. It is about the same size of a refrigerator you would store in a college dorm room and is hidden inside a stand by the dresser/TV cabinet. My only complaint about the room was the bed. It just seemed like the should use higher quality beds there but they were still comfortable enough for me. Make sure to look for the hidden Mickeys in the shower curtain and the bed comforter. We loved the fact that there are lots of areas where you can just sit and relax with friends while having a few drinks. There are several indoors and outdoors. Most of the seats for these \"relax\" areas are wooden rocking chairs which I thought were very comfortable. We mostly ate breakfast at the Mara quick serve place but we did go to Boma once for breakfast. We liked it but honestly you can get most of the stuff at Mara for a lot cheaper. Everyone says the dinner is the best but we were always at the parks during this time so we never got a chance to experience it. We also didn't get a chance to eat at Jiko. The bar area which is called Victoria Falls is right above Boma and the bar tender was great. My only real complaint was the wait at the concierge desk. It took an obsurd about of time just to get through this line. Even being the third person in line took 20 minutes. They only have two people working the desk at a time. This isn't a complaint towards the cast members who were working the concierge desk because they were super helpful to each and every guest who needed help. They just needed to have an additional person or two working the desk if there are people in line since usually people have a lot of questions or time consuming questions. My advice is do research before going to Disney World so you don't have any questions that need to be answered by the concierge in the hotel. We drove and have season passes (come with the wedding package) and we didn't use the buses so I can't comment on that. Driving to the parks didn't take long at all. You are obviously next to the Animal Kingdom and the other parks were within a 15 minute drive of the hotel. Not bad at all in my opinion. The last night we were there, they placed a few chocolates on the bed. One is a large one that has the AKL logo on it. It was neat and delicious. Overall I loved this hotel and would definitely come back. We got a reduce rate since we have annual passes and paid around 1200 for 5 nights. That is about 240 a night and I thought it was a good value for that price. Some tips I could offer is to stay on the 3rd or 4th floor if you get a savannah view. It just made viewing the animals better than the lower floors. Also, bring your own set of binoculars if you have them.

This was our first trip to Disney. Basically one should give some time to explore the hotel if staying here as we spent breakfasts on our balcony (in July!) watching the various animals feeding. Most exciting for us were the giraffes and zebras. I will admit that after staying here the Kilimanjaro safari ride, although great, probably lost some luster given that we could see many of the same animals from our hotel room. At this location, there are activities scheduled during the day which would have been nice to participate in if we had enough time. The pool looked very inviting, but we were unable to take advantage of due to some very strong afternoon thunderstorms that closed the pools down for the two days of our stay. A few specific notes: we were delayed 4 hours on our arrival and got in late. We used Disney Magical Express, but didn't get our bags delivered to our room that first night. The hotel staff was very good about getting us toiletries and diapers free of charge when we asked. We also got a credit, which was nice considering that we changed plans for the next day waiting for our luggage. Given that this is Disney, though, the credit would not go very far in terms of replacing a lost bag. Hopefully that is already obvious. For restaurants onsite, we were not on a meal plan. We intended to eat at Boma but decided that the quick service Mara was perfectly fine for us and saved probably about $80 by doing so, especially given that we weren't hungry when our reservation was scheduled. BTW, just because you have a reservation via Disney's website doesn't mean that you will be seated immediately - another reason why Mara was appreciated by us for our kids that had to eat NOW. One nice things about the rooms is that they are pretty quiet. We really couldn't hear the people around us. The hotel must have thick walls. We also didn't have a car, so we used the buses. We only traveled to the Animal Kingdom park from this hotel. Since that is the closest destination from this accommodation, one thing we didn't consider were the bus time waits. The buses run frequently, but there was at least one time where we had to wait for the next bus due to the number of people waiting to return to the hotel. One last observation - it was very much appreciated by myself and my wife that the Disney cast members (staff) are very friendly in greeting you and not in a fake way.

Let me just say that, this resort is still magical! The property itself is huge, with plenty of activity for those who are unwinding after a day in the parks. The lobby is wonderful to walk though and sit in, with daily activities provided for the guests. Zawadi, the obligatory gift shop, provides some non-standard souvenirs for vacation goers and easy pick up for purchases from the park. Check-in to our Arusha View room was smooth, with a quick luggage delivery to our room. The room itself, a bunk bed set up, was very clean and had a wonderful view of the savannah. We were able to see antelope, giraffe, zebra, and various types of birds during our stay. I do wish that Disney would provide free WiFi in their guest rooms though, since its a standard in many cheaper hotels these days. Unfortunately, we did not have much of an opportunity to sample any of the more upscale restaurants on the property. However, if you want a decent value, I suggest going to the Mara for a quick bite to eat. Its easily accessible to the pool. ((Hint: If staying for a week, invest in one those 14 dollar travel mugs that are offered. Its well worth it for the stay.) The pool was very clean and there was plenty to do for both parents and kids. Daily activities like water basketball and a mini water slide were available for the young one's and the pool side bar the hot tub are there for the parents. If you're a person who enjoys getting a bit of exercise each day, don't worry, the Lodge has you covered! The fitness room alongside the pool is very clean and has a variety of machines to use. Whether you want to work on cardio or weight training, there is something for the exercise buff to do. However, due to the security lock being in disuse, you will need to hand your room key over to the attendant. Not a big deal though. Finally, as with any other Disney resort, take advantage of the buses!

There were other anmals we couldn't identify, but at checkin we were given a list with pictures so that we could identify the animals from our room. It was SO cool. There was also an overlook at the hotel with a guide that would tell you about the animals if you asked. They even had nightvision goggles! The buses to the parks were available right at the hotel. We did really hit up the pool as it rained for our whole trip. On my husband's birthday, he was given a pin that said it was his birthday & I got an \"I'm celebrating\" pin. All day staff everywhere wished my husband a happy birthday. It was really nice. Some rides even moved us up in the line because of the birthday pins! We only ate at one restaurant in the hotel ( I don't remember the name, but it was right next to the pool.) It had the BEST butternut squash soup I have ever had in my entire life....I ate it 3 times! I have a food allergy, and the chef came out of the kitchen to talk with me about my allergy and told me my options. Actually, everywhere I went in Disney the chef came out to talk to me about my allergy. I have never been anywhere else that was so accomodating The chef would often deliver my meal right to my table!

I would have my coffee in the morning and just marvel over the beautiful lobby. Everything was immaculate. That was the best part of the trip. I didn't find fault with the bus service. When going to Disney, you have to expect to wait. I didn't feel that the hotel was that far like other people mentioned. I was a little disenchanted with check in. We arrived around 11:00 and were told that they'd put a rush on our room. We waited about 3 1/2 hours for the room to be ready. I understand we were early but don't tell us that there was a rush when clearly there wasn't. The room, while very clean, was very small. There was only 2 drawers which did not accommodate a family of 4. I had to leave my clothing in the suitcase for the duration of the trip. For an expensive hotel, I found the room to be borderline motel-ish. We also did not get housekeeping one day and on another my 15 year old son called the front desk for housekeeping. The Mara was okay. There wasn't much of a variety especially for breakfast. The smells coming from the Boma for the breakfast buffet were very enticing but it was too pricey to spend over $100 for a breakfast. We did eat in the Boma for dinner. That was so-so...also pricey. We were on the Disney plan and I highly recommend doing that. The gym was okay too. Clean. What I found very weird was that they had the smoking section right in front of the gym! So after a good workout, I was rewarded with a big inhale of smoke upon leaving the gym!! Another disappointment is just a Disney thing...the prices for drinks were out of control!! I don't drink a lot but on vacation I do like to have a cocktail or two. My husband and I spent $40 in 10 minutes having a couple of drinks!!! That's kind of insane. But I know that's a \"rip people off on vacation thing\"! This was my 4th trip to Disney. I didn't hate Animal Kingdom but I didn't love it.

Upon arrival is was pouring buckets! They helped us empty the car and took our items up to our room for us which worked out great. We even got them to help us when we checked out. We had a one bedroom Condo.. In the living room there is a pull out couch and a chair, this Condo has just one bathroom. The 'bowl' is in a separate room but its still in the bathroom. Which means someone cant use the 'bowl' if there is someone in the shower. I would have thought that a 1 bedroom suite would have had two bathrooms - as a two bedroom has 3 bathrooms. There is a full kitchen which works great for keep costs down and having meals in the room instead of outside at the parks. And a separate bedroom with a queen bed, which is not a master bedroom. There is a washer and dryer which helps too. The bathroom has a double sink and a jacuzzi tub and its a little difficult to get into because it is pretty high, so one may have to sit on the side and throw your leg over. The bedroom and Living room has their own TVs and access to the outside deck. We had a pool view but you really couldn't tell since there are these rather large trees blocking the view of the pool. There is internet access, Free for DVC members but a fee for everyone else. We are amazed a how the sliding glass doors keep the sounds out of the rooms! At night they have been having a movie at the pool side and its pretty loud with the doors open but once they are closed its pretty quiet! You cant even hear anyone walking down the halls. I am impressed with that. The Jambo house itself its rather large. The buildings have 5 floors and a few 'wings', there is a large store at the main level and a lot of activities daily. Parking is a little far of a walk in Jambo house, when we were in Kidani Village the parking was below the building so its just an elevator ride down. This parking area is across the main entrance and down a little ways and no coverage from the sun. As DVC members they offer a towel exchange once every 3 days and a clean every 4 days. Without the DVC membership it would cost a lot more. It happens the week we stayed we never got a 'full clean' just a towel exchange. Kinda strange. We happened to have some dirty dishes and spoke with the front desk, they changed the dishes immediately for us. Of course everything is decked out in Animal Motif. There is even a sign when you leave the property that says... watch out for Poachers. Around certain areas of the building you can see the savannah. Do you need a room with view of it?

There is no door to separate the bathroom area to the rest of the room so we had one suitcase on a luggage rack in the sink area of the bathroom. We had three other suitcases and and there was not enough space to leave these open whilst being in the room. You have to open a suitcase, get what you want out of it and close it afterwards so it can lean vertically against a wall. The bedding is terrible as well, the pillows are not standard size, they are 2/3 of a standard size pillow, and the sheets are very very basic with very old blankets and worn out bedspreads. Very surprising standard - not at all what we expected. I have no idea how a family of four can manage in these standard rooms.

The rooms have gone up in price since we stayed there, so I do not know if we will be back anytime soon.

We'd chosen it specifically because it offered bunk beds, which very few Disney hotels do, as our girls are now so far apart in age, they have gone beyond sharing a bed, however large or comfortable. The hotel was lovely - the decor was fantastically themed, and everything else was as you'd expect from a hotel with this rating. The stay wasn't totally trouble free, however! About a week before we travelled, I rang the hotel to check that my request for a room with bunk beds, which I'd made with Virgin, had been noted. It hadn't, so the very helpful lady in Customer Relations I spoke to assured me that we would have a family room with bunk beds. On arrival, we were taken to a beautifully appointed room with a fantastic savannah view (which we'd booked) with - you're guessed it - two queen size beds! One complaining telephone call and about hour later, we were moved to another equally lovely room, WITH bunk beds! Result! The restaurants were excellent. Boma was fantastic - there was something even for the fussiest eater, though for dinner I'd recommend making a reservation. The breakfast buffet there was brilliant - try the jungle juice, it was delicious. Even the fast food restaurant, the Mara, was a step up from other fast food restaurants in Disney hotels. They've adopted the system that operates in many of the theme park restaurants - you order your food, and receive a buzzy machine that vibrates and makes a noise when your order is ready. It's much a better system because your food is hot when it arrives, and some people aren't eating whilst others are waiting for theirs. Not sure if that system is operating on all the other Disney hotels - if it isn't, it should be! The view of the animals (whether from the rooms or from the viewing areas) is a bonus, and my husband and I would have been more than pleased to sit with a glass of wine and just watch them wandering past the balcony, but our girls, of course, had other ideas! We had a lovely stay, and we were genuinely sad to leave at the end of the two weeks. We probably didn't make as much of the hotel as we could have - there were plenty of activities we didn't take part in, and parts of the complex we didn't explore, but we did what we wanted in very luxurious surroundings.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMy other half loved it I'm not so sure\u201d", "Author": "London_Tripper1", "ReviewID": "UR115540355", "Content": "My partner chose this hotel as he wanted his Mom to get an authentic African experience as she is at an age when she is unlikely to be able to travel to Africa.

The lobby area is magnificent and the rooms are surprisingly big. The lobby is on level 3, rooms on Levels 2 to 6 (?) with the fitness suite and restaurants on level 1. The pool is certainly big but not deep and they have 3 lifeguards on duty during pool hours, they truly keep a close eye on things. We did build the pool up in our heads in be bigger than it actually was based on what we have heard but it is ample for the size of the resort. The Mara (quick service) is clean and provides a reasonable selection however can be pricey (unless on DDP like we were). The resort mug can also be filled up here however it can only be filled up here meaning if your in your room you have a small walk to fill it up.... ideal for using around the pool however. Both restaurants are lovely but very different, one is a buffet and the other is signature dinning. We did the hotel resort guests only safari which included a massive selection of food from the signature restaurant with the chef introducing each meal, the Safari was close and personal but the meal really made is special. We found the hotel's corridors can get a little loud during the morning and after parking closing at night, people tend to pass your room speaking in full volume which can annoy slightly if your having a lazy night. Having a room as far along as possible will certainly help. While we don't have kids they appeared to have plenty of activities for them which appeared to play in to the african culture. The hotel staff are as you would expect, extremely friendly! The car park can get VERY busy so if you arrive back late you can expect to park right at the back, minor point really.

It is a large hotel but no where near as bad as what some folks are writing here. Our room was at the end of Kudu Trail (room 4394) and it's nowhere near a half mile from the lobby. As a runner I am a pretty good judge of distance in quarter mile increments and it would be a stretch to say it was even that far.

I know that the AKL is a bit off from the rest of Disney parks, but really it's not that long of a drive.

I have stayed in studio, 1 & 2 bedroom rooms here, and each one is unique and has full services to offer guests, including views of the animals and savannah from the balconies. It's incredibly refreshing to wake up with a cup of coffee in the mornings and see giraffes running around outside your room before you prepare to spend the day at the parks. These kinds of experiences are what Disney magic is all about. If you have a 1 - 2 bedroom villa and have your own rental car, there is a handy Winn-Dixie about 10 minutes away, as well as a Publix about the same distance in a different direction where you can fill up your kitchen with groceries. I'd advise against Disney's grocery stores because a) the selection is quite minimal and b) it's incredibly overpriced. My family and I ate breakfasts and dinners back in the room and it made the food on the trip much more affordable.

Usually, we stayed at the value resorts, but we splurged for this trip since it was celebrating big birthdays for both of us.

However, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, we found the front desk to be AWFUL during this trip at several times--particularly when checking in--and infact, I discussed the same with the front desk manager, Tina, who offered me a one-day park pass as consolation and listened to me with concern. (I also expressed my concerns to Disney in an online survey afterwards, to which I received no response.) Just last week (June 21) I returned to this resort with my boyfriend, who had never been to a Disney resort before. Six months since my last trip and nothing about the front desk had changed!! The woman (I will omit her name) standing behind the young man checking us in actually looked bored and/or irritated the entire time we were in line and checking in (about 25 minutes) and it was hard NOT to say something to her about her expression. The man checking us in NEVER smiled either! Now I do not work in customer service for a living, but I know that you should at least SMILE at the customers as they arrive and make them feel welcome! The first time I hoped it was a fluke, but after this second trip, I am not so sure. The other place that I found the workers to be dreary at best, was Mara, the cafeteria. On both stays, only ONE worker smiled at us when ordering or paying for the meals. I would rank every other aspect of this resort as outstanding--the theming, lobby, views, animals, food and the savannah rooms. But I seriously suggest that Disney retrain or refocus the AKL front desk on making a much better initial impression for this resort. One other tip--we took a walk to the new Kidani Village. Their new restaurant, Sanaa, was great and offers an incredible view of the savannah while you eat! Afterwards, we walked out on an extension hear the restaurant that basically sits inside the savannah and got a much better view of the animals than anywhere at AKL. We watched the mother and baby giraffe, ostriches and a group of zebras running around for an hour.

Unbelievable artisan craftsmanship is everywhere (every room's door has its own unique carved wood panel). But the best part of the whole experience for us is the savanna that is just outside your balcony. Throughout the day, animals indigenous to Africa wander in and out of the savanna. Even if you don't have a room facing the savanna, there are public spaces that you can go to view these beautiful creatures. (There's nothing like having your breakfast on the balcony, as a giraffe has his morning treat just feet away!) There is so much for kids to do, from swimming in the enormous pool, to playing on the playground, to speaking with the savanna guides about the animals or their home country, to decorating their own animal cookie in the restaurant (one of the many kids programs).

Having never been to Disney before, I was very excited. Here is the breakdown: Lobby : Awesome! Breathtaking welcome. Plenty of seating for when you are waiting for others, TV's built into the furniture - which you wouldn't notice right away. Big open space, high high ceiling, intricate detail... good start. Rooms: We stayed in one of the Vacation Club suites which held all 12 of us comfortably. With 3 bedrooms, four bathrooms, a full swanky kitchen equipped with all the necessities. It also boasted 3 large balconies (which you could only use for a few minutes at a time because of the giant wasps who have made their home there as well) There was a pool table and an impressive solid wood dining table that comfortably sat everyone at once. Food: Meh. Really that sums it up. On our first night we all tried something different I had the double chicken dinner (counter service at The Mara). It was really just edible. Pool: Beautiful! Good Size. You never felt like there wasn't room. While it could take a minute to find a lounge chair - you will find one. There's a bar right beside the pool - so if you want to hang out, watch the game, catch a drink.. you can. The drinks however are - i guess what you'd expect from Disney - EXPENSIVE. For a whopping $10 i got a pina colada - which i can not guarantee even had alcohol in it. Extras: I don't have any children but other aspects of the Resort that I checked out were the Simba's Room (looked like a play room for kids - daycare maybe?) Arcade, and at the pool a nice big slide (which I did try a few times!) Customer Service: Ok now for the part the really disappointed me... Customer Service. I come from a customer service centric business to begin with... so my standards are already up there. Then you think Disney... Customer Service Leaders in the industry. Rumor had it - you couldn't find a miserable employee.... Well to set the record straight... I found them. At the Jambo House, Animal Kingdom Lodge. Quick Summary: It begins with our very first stop - check in. We waited in line.... and waited... and waited... while other people all around us(in other lines ie Consierge) were serviced and we were ignored. Hmmm. interesting I thought. We physically moved our selves and luggage to another line (not designated to check in) so we could get some service. Consierge. Multilple frustrations with these folks. First... very short... and unfriendly. The funny thing is every time you go up to the counter they say \"Welcome Home\" have you ever heard the expression \"it's not what you say it's how you say it\" ? Their tone , coupled with their board expression said \"i'm saying this because I have to\". Anyway - to keep this short I had to visit these folks four times because I kept getting the runaround. I've never been told \"We can't do that\" or \"who told you that\" or \"if that's what tickets told you go see them\". No ownership and certainly no desire to actually help. We wanted to make dinner reservations at a restaurant in epcot where you could see the fireworks... we were given Bistro De Paris (great food) but absolutely NO view of the fireworks. We had to leave our dinners and the restaurant to go see the fireworks and then return. This would be ok... if the expectation wasn't already set for \"the best seat in the house\". Crappy service, a giant lack of knowledge on how things work and zero commitment to make our experience a great one. Very disappointed here.

We paid additional money and upgraded ourselves to a conceirge level room complete with a view overlooking the Savvana. The concierge level floor gave us access to a lounge where a free breakfast was served along with snacks all day long (including alcoholic beverages in the evening with dessert) and it also allowed us to purchase tickets to the early morning safari tour (this was well worth the money by the way). The concierge level also gave us access to the concierge who would plan our stay for us before we arrived. This service was excellent and I cannot speak highly enough of the concierge service. Check in was not the smoothest, whilst the cast member was very friendly she could not find our reservation for quite some time and did not tell us we needed to prepay the entire bill on arrival. One of the priveleges of staying on site is that you can use your room key to charge back to your account at any of the Disney properties or parks. After a moonlight swim I decided to make a purchase at the on site store but my card was not working. I was referred back to reception and told this was because our account was not paid in full. So I had to go back to my room and then back down to pay for the item and then pay the account in the morning. Fair enough. However when I tried to make a purchase later the next day elsewhere, again I was not allowed to. Another visit to reception and they promised it was now fixed. Not so, I would learn later that day. Finally on the third occasion it was fixed. We also got a recorded voicemail message on a couple of nights telling us that we were checking out tomorrow morning and that we could use express check out. This was always met with a 'sorry it is just a mistake' response from reception when we called them to say we were not checking out, but it was just annoying little things like this that made our holiday less relaxing. We had an issue losing our tv reception and we asked for this to be fixed whilst we were out. We got back later that night and this was not fixed. We got it fixed the next day but would have enjoyed watching tv that night after a tiring day in the park. Upon arrival there were two lovely gifts for our anniversary and my birthday. There were also some lovely chocolates in the room. The room is a wonderful size and the housekeeping was great (we always tip daily). It was also very special to see giraffe, wildebeest, zebra, buffalo and an array of birds outside our window every day. Dinner at JIKO (Onsite restaurant) was very nice.

The Loddy is huge and it just feels very comfortable. I arrived at 1pm and I'm able to check in right away. I loved this hotel very much because this hotel is very speical. It is surrounded by trees and there's a lot of animals to see from your hotel room. The animals mostly come out at night because of the hot weather. The only problem is the room might be a little smaller than other hotels, but I only have two people so it really doesnt bother me much. The bus also takes longer to travel to magic kingdom and epcot (20 minutes), because they're pretty far away from each other. However, travelling to animal kingdom only takes you about 10 minutes. It wasnt an issue to me because I can walk and i dont have kids with me, but if you have older people or kids you might want to get them a wheelchair or a stroller for easier trasportation. The travelling isnt that bad because it has its own bus, so you dont have to share the bus with other resorts. My girlfriend did found a roach in the bathroom though, I think that it somehow crawled from the animal side into our room. I just flushed it into the toliet so it wasnt such a big deal. I personally think that it is a great hotel. I like the theme, the staff and the environment. But I'm sure not everybody like what I like.

Parking is free at all Disney Parks and the Resort for guests staying on Disney property. Renting a car is easy enough, Alamo picks you up and drops you off at your resort.

It was a great experience for our first-ever trip to WDW (2 parents and 1 teen). However, it wasn't without its faults. None were severe, but we'll likely stay somewhere else next time, for variety's sake, and to save money. Service was very fine. We appreciated the attentiveness and professionalism. However, I'm not sure our check-in cast member understood the dining plan very well, because she couldn't explain it to us very clearly. I'd appreciate having a better knowledge of it, overall - not just a AKL issue, clearly. The pool was clean and large. I'd prefer a little more \"deep end\" in it, but that's hardly a reason to complain. I did notice gravelly silt on the bottom of one of the hot tubs - we had to do a search-mission to find it. We had \"coupons\" for the arcade but had no idea how to redeem them. I was underwhelmed by the Savannah View room. It's OK though, because it was a free upgrade from a Pool View room, due to their ENTIRE Disney customer system being down when we arrived at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday. They couldn't check us in, so we had temporary tickets all day and had to pay for food \"manually\" (and get it reimbursed later). Disney took care of us, but there was some extra effort and frustration involved. The buses took FOREVER to get to AKL. I suppose this is due to its location. My advice: if you see a bus at AKL that's headed for your desired park, do whatever you have to do to catch it. It could be 30-40 minutes before you see another one. Run, flag it down, whistle, whatever. This goes for return trips to AKL from the parks, too. Some friends built up Boma as the best place to eat in all of WDW. We saved it for our last evening at WDW, and all three of us were severely underwhelmed. I've had better hotel buffets in resorts in 3rd world countries. As much as we paid for WDW and their dining plan, I truly had higher expectations. The service was delightful. Our less-than-satisfaction was strictly from the food. We're taking this up with our friends, btw. I wish AKL, or WDW in general, did more for first-timers. We'll certainly go back, because the WDW experience is one-of-a-kind. However, we'll be better armed and educated. MAKE DINNER RESERVATIONS 2 MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF YOUR ARRIVAL. The other item I'll mention has nothing to do with AKL and refers more to a factor of WDW overall. You will run into some of the rudest, most inconsiderate people in the world who are guests of WDW. They'll run their strollers over you and into you, and they won't care. They'll push to get ahead of you in line, and they won't look back. More than the heat, more than the miles of walking each day, more than the waiting for buses, and more than the frustrations with not knowing some key details about WDW (as first-timers), the rude guests were my biggest complaint. I don't suppose there's anything WDW can do about it. The presence of these folks wasn't a huge surprise.

While it was great to stay on Disney property, I wasn't sure if it was worth what we'd paid that time around. I decided to stay at AKL this time around, but only for 3 nights, just in case I felt the same way. The last 3 were at a Downtown Disney hotel. I wish I'd stayed at AKL for the whole trip! We had a bunk bed pool view room and it couldn't have been better. I decided to pass on the savannah view based on some of the reviews, plus we knew we could see animals if we really wanted to. Having them in view from our room wasn't a priority. The location turned out to be absolutely perfect. Took less than 2 minutes to get to the pool and outside to the bus waiting area. We discovered that if you just hopped down 5 quick steps in the stairwell, there was a door that led right out to that area. We rarely used the elevator to get anywhere. The room itself was very tastefully decorated, clean, and larger than what I was expecting. The only minor complaints I have are that the bed squeaked every time you moved. With me being a light sleeper, that made for not quite peaceful sleep. Also, every morning at around 6 am, I was awoken by, and could clearly hear the toilets flushing from adjacent rooms. Also, the a/c didn't seem to cool the room enough at night. But I was thrilled that it had a ceiling fan! I've always had trouble sleeping in hotel rooms because I'm so used to sleeping with one. The wait for the buses was tolerable, but why does it seem that no matter what park you're going to, that stop is the only one with a crowd??? The buses did get crowded and was standing room only at times. Ok, a little OT rant here, but chivalry appears to be dead, at least at Disney. I thought it was pathetic that there were women and children standing, meanwhile several able-bodied, seemingly healthy men sat in their seats and watched them hanging onto the rails, stumbling and trying to keep their balance during the ride. You may not want to give up your seat, but it's polite to at least offer. My husband gave up his seat each time to a woman, especially if she was holding a small child. I was actually bummed to check out 3 nights into our trip. Our other hotel was fine, but I missed the ambience of the AKL. The only sour note of our experience here would be that when we checked in, we were told that we'd been upgraded to a savannah view. While I understand, this may be considered an upgrade, I didn't like it at all. I specifically reserved a pool view because I like a pool view. Turns out they were short on pool view rooms and tried to stick us in a sunset savannah view room, which was a downgrade in my opinion. That room was not what I wanted. It looked like a view of dirt and was quite a walk from everything. I went back and told them that I really just wanted the room I'd reserved. We had to wait at the desk for 30 minutes while she went in the back to get us into a pool view room. Not a great way to start the vacation, but we got over it.

They were very friendly.The inside of the hotel was beautiful. It was unique in its own way. Now let me tell you the bad. The room was overpriced. Do not pay for a savanna view because you rarely saw the animals. The rooms are small and overpriced. Trust me there is no thrills or highlights about this room to mention. The air conditioner did not keep the room cold. I\u2019d called the third day into our stay . Someone came and looked at it but didn\u2019t fix it. So, I\u2019d had to call again the next day. Finally they fix it. They had to change a coil or something. So, that tells me that whomever looked at the air system really did not look. The last two night we had noisy neighbors. They woke us up in the middle of the night both nights. THE kids were screaming and the parents were yelling. It was horrible. Why would you put a double bed room right next to a queen size room only. That makes no sense. They should have a floor with just single beds. It should not be mixed. I\u2019d called to complain but they said that they would move us, but we only had one more day. So, we decided to stay in the same room they were so nice to give me 75 dollars off my bill. What a joke. The transportation was alright. If you wanted to go to the ticket place you had to go catch the bus, then go to another park, to catch another bus. I would not take at this hotel again.

We had stayed at this resort once before when it first opened and really enjoyed it. This time, we were going for the gusto with a club level, savannah view room and reservations for the Sunrise Safari. Arrival: We arrived around 9:00 p.m. and noticed that we weren't greeted by a cast member immediately and checked in privately which is the practice at the Grand Floridian when one stays club level. Later on we were told that this is only available for guests arriving until mid-afternoon. We waited on line to get our keys and a lot of confusion ensued. The cast member who helped us was very sweet and full of energy, but not so clear on our needs. She was very excited to make DH a birthday button with his name on it. Then, she gave us our room keys and then told us we would have to get new gold keys in the club lounge. The club lounge closed at 9:30, so we had to get our keys the next morning. I had ordered a special birthday hat delivered to the room through the itinerary planning office, but when I asked about it, no one had heard of it, although there had been lengthy email exchange prior to our visit to confirm that the hat would be there and I had authorized charges on my credit card. Luckily, the charge had not gone through and I wound up buying a different, better hat for my husband in the gift shop. Public spaces: The lobby of the AKL is truly breathtaking. The designers put a great deal of care into respecting the African design influence without making it kitschy. There is so much to look at and so many interesting African artifacts that it is like a museum. The use of dark woods and colorful prints is lovely and, although the lobby is similar in structure to the Wilderness Lodge, it seems to have much more light. There are also interesting touches such as a bridge to cross in the lobby. Keep an eye out for hidden Mickeys! Once you leave the lobby, there are multiple animal viewing spots inside and outside, such as Arusha Rock Overlook. The landscaping is beautiful and evokes a sense of the jungle without seeming untamed.We love the pool area with its zero entry area and fun water slide. The whole area around the pool has a terrifically relaxing atmosphere. It wasn't at all crowded during our visit. Guest rooms: The room was really fun with dark woods and brightly colored, African print bedspreads. It would be nice if Disney resorts would enter the 21st century and add some duvets and comforters, but the bedspreads are usually part of the theming. We had a good view of the savannah from our balcony, but it seemed not to have as many animals as we remembered. The room was a good size, though perhaps not as large as the rooms at the Grand Floridian or the Polynesian. Because we were celebrating a 50th birthday, we received gifts and a birthday cake. Because we had cancelled our August anniversary trip when I broke my foot, the AKL staff had also left us anniversary gifts and anniversary buttons to wear in the parks. Club Lounge: The club lounge is on a different floor from the club level rooms. It offers a breakfast that is slightly more than continental, yet not generous enough to be called full, snacks such as hummus around lunch time, and appetizers before dinner. We didn't really make use of the club services so much, except for tasks like printing out our boarding passes. Also, you have to be a club level guest to take the Sunrise Safari tour, so all safari participants congregated in the club lounge in the very early morning before taking the tour. Sunrise Safari: The Sunrise Safari at the Animal Kingdom Theme Park is only available to club level guests and it is not inexpensive, but it is really worth it. DH loves photography and the photos he was able to take with the new camera he received for his birthday were excellent. After the safari, you have a very good buffet breakfast at Pizza-fari in the Animal Kingdom Park. Restaurants: We had dinner at Boma and Jiko and loved both. Boma is a buffet with a fair number of interesting African dishes and enough American cuisine to satisfy the non-adventurous eater. The service was very friendly and we had more than enough food to choose from. The roasted pork dish was very tasty and I would definitely recommend sampling the sweet potato pancakes. Leave room for the Zebra Domes at the dessert station. DH's birthday dinner was at Jiko and it was absolutely perfect. Our server was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The menu selection was great---sort of nouveau African cuisine. Definitely try the \"Taste of Africa\" appetizer. I had the shrimp curry with Durban curry sauce, DH had the short ribs and our son had the Filet Mignon. Our server brought a great chocolate mousse birthday cake for dessert. The atmosphere in Jiko is upscale and beautiful, but still very relaxed. We would definitely return to both restaurants. As for the counter service restaurant, Mara, we bought lunch there one day and it was very good and the salad greens were fresh. Convenience: I've read many reviews that complain about the distance to the Disney parks from AKL. Granted, it is not on the monorail and it is true that the bus rides can be long-ish. We rented a car. The one day we did take the bus back from the parks, we found that it took a long time and that the bus stopped at Kidani Village (Disney Vacation Club) before the lodge itself which tacked on a few more minutes. I would definitely recommend renting a car if you choose the AKL. Overall, the AKL is a wonderful property with great on-site dining options and many intriguing cultural touches. Let's not forget that you can sit on your balcony and watch zebras and giraffes which makes it a very special place indeed.

Our room was small and had no microwave (you must pay if you want wi-fi). But it was decorated nicely, kept clean, had a lttle deck (which we used for spraying on our sunscreen), and had gorgeous views of the animals. They hire many international people from around the globe at Disney, and many work here. We liked the laid-back atmosphere of the guests, and the attentive staff who seemed genuine with their friendly helpfulness. The only exception was this: in advance of our stay, we had a package delivered to the hotel, and they told us to wait in the room and they would bring it to us, saying they could not leave it in the room without us being present. Two phone calls and one hour later, it still had not arrived. We finally went to the front desk and asked for them to give it to us, which they did. This was annoying because they had first told us that the delivery was imminent, so we wasted time sitting around in our room waiting for it. The food here is excellent, and better than at most of the properties at Disney, especially if you like ethnic food leaning towards Indian and African, but also for hot sandwiches and so on. Boma was great (a buffet featuring seafood, steak, other meats and stews, great side dishes, etc.) Sanaa was good though the dining plan didn't include naan (!!??); the prices are jacked up so the tip is always enormous ($20 for a family of four, typically) We used the Disney Dining Plan which is pretty essential in our opinion if you don't plan to travel off-site to dine (tips not included though), since food prices are terribly high otherwise. It takes about 20 minutes or so to get to Magic Kingdom or Epcot using the Disney bus service which was fine for us since we didn't use a car while here. In the future, I would consider renting a car, since parking is complimentary, and eating off-site would have probably saved money overall since food is so over-priced on-site. Also, if we'd stayed longer, we would have wanted more dining choices. But we had a promotion that gave us the dining plan for \"free\", so it worked out fine. The pool was lovely. The gift shop sells everything including milk, snacks, convenience foods, clothing, gifts, and more. It is large! We enjoyed our stay and would probably reccomend this hotel to others, but for us, it was probably a one-time deal. In the future, I think we could have a more luxurious stay off-site for far less money even with the rental car added in.

Had stayed at Kidani but this was first time at the Lodge. Stayed at both places in a studio. This trip we spent 2 nights in a Deluxe Studio w/Savannah View; spent the 3rd night in a Value Studio w/Pool View. The Deluxe was near the elevator on the 5th fl and the view of the animals was great. There seems to be a bigger rotation or more animals at the Lodge. At Kidani we saw the same animals from our balcony all day every day; at the Lodge the animals changed throughout the day. There was no noise problem being near the elevator. Both Lodge studios had a queen bed, pull-out sofa, and flat screen TV. Bathrooms were the same in both. The only real difference was the size of the closet/armoire, and there was a small desk in the Value instead of the round table that was in the Deluxe. Pool view was noisy on the balcony, but no pool noise could be heard inside. The lobby was much bigger at the Lodge, as well as the gift shop. There are more scheduled family activities at the Lodge than at Kidani. There are a lot more choices for dining here also. Food was fine the one time we ate quick-service poolside. The parking lot can be a hike to the lobby at the Lodge; Kidani has a covered parking garage with elevator. The pool at the Lodge is larger, but the slide is the same at both places. The Deluxe Studios at Kidani are bigger than at the Lodge, so if you need more room stay at Kidani. My largest complaint is that there was no hot water in our room on the second morning, and I have never had that happen at Disney. Otherwise we liked the Lodge, but would pick Kidani. Kidani has easier parking, a more laid-back feeling, and you don't have to walk through the lobby every time you want to go to your room. The Lodge has more of a hotel/resort feeling.

The best thing you could do if you are staying at a disney resort is purchase some sort of dinning plan. I personally like the Deluxe plan but the regular one is pretty good too. The only problem I ran into was that I had to take our little guy out of his stroller when boarding the buses. The bus rides aren't that long but with a one year old I found it pretty difficult.

This was not a bad thing since the walk to the room is so pleasant to just look out at the Savannah (not to mention all the hidden Mickey's my 4 year old grandson found in the carpet!). When we first got to our room, we opened the door, went straight to the balcony to look out and immediately saw a mama, daddy and baby giraffe right outside the balcony. We saw so many animals all the time! It is just fun to look at the sheet they give you to identify them and read about them. The decor at Jambo House is so beautiful. I love the dark, glossy wood in the lobby, the fire pit, all the animal carvings and well, just everything down to the African music playing. The food at Boma, and the Mara is delicious as well. We spent all evening one night at the pool at Kidani Village where they had a movie under the stars. The water play area for kids is *so* much fun.

The smell of indian spice or incense is extremely relaxing, to some people it was annoying.

Its out of the way compared to other resorts yet for us it was like \"going home\" after a long day in the park. I want to go back in the worst way. The animals are right outside your window or lobby, the theming is so relaxing you can not help but be completely centered and grounded when you check out. If you like the smell of incense, the sound of drums or africian music in the background, animals right outside your door and you want to relax when you get back from the parks, this is the place for you. If you like the beach, noise, children EVERYWHERE then maybe the beach club would suit your tastes better. I am a very particular person who is a clean freak and with pretty high standards when it comes to spending money on vacation... the only regret I have is not spending an entire day at this resort without going to the park.

You can skip the baggage claim step at the airport. Be warned, it can take up to 3 hours for the luggage to be delivered. Pack items that you want to use right away in your carry on (ie. Swimsuits, electronics etc) The Weather can swing from hot to warm to cool. Take a light sweater. Getting around \u2013 Alamo has a location on site near Magic Kingdom. Arrange rental from your room. They pick you up at your hotel, take you to the Alamo, you return it there and they shuttle you back to your hotel. It is quite expensive.

The shuttle buses run every 15 \u2013 20 minutes from resort to park and vice versa. Customer Service - My husband left a bag with electronics on the bus from the airport stemming from confusion about Kidani vs Jambo. Neither was identified prior to the trip so he went to ask the bus driver and in the confusion with two kids, we hurried off the bus and forgot the bag. If you do this, tell reception, they will open a claim. It takes about 2 days to get things back. My son also left his snake stuffy somewhere in the lobby and it was delivered to our room. We did not encounter any poor customer service on the resort and very little at the parks. Animal Kingdom Lodge \u2013 beautiful d\u00e9cor in the lobby, bright & pleasant cast members, rooms are small but nice, a little smelly outside due to the animals at times but c\u2019mon, it\u2019s AKL. It\u2019s not a large resort to get around. Nice pool, zero entry. Lots of spaces to see animals even if you don\u2019t have a Savannah view room, towels available at the pool free of charge, lots of lifeguards, nice slide, lots of chairs, several hot tubs, a wading pool, playground. The pool doesn\u2019t get deeper than about 4.5ft. Your room card is also your park ticket, on property \u201ccredit card\u201d and meal plan voucher. Card was blanked several times for room entry and had to keep going back to reception. It worked great at the parks and for meals. If you buy items at the parks, they will deliver to your hotel. You don\u2019t have to drag purchases through the park. Laundry self service near the pool. Meal Plan \u2013 We had a snack, a Quick Serve and a Table Serve each day for each person. A snack can be a muffin, a whole fruit, a smoothie, ice cream bar. A quick serve can be sandwiches, wrap, pizza, with a dessert and non-alcoholic drink. For kids, example, cheese pizza, milk, grapes and jello. You can buy mugs at the resort. They are good for unlimited hot and cold beverages at the resorts only. They are about $15 each. We used them to our full advantage, free coffee at the fountain instead of using a snack credit. Allears.net has the menus for the restaurants. Seem quite current with what we had. We ate at Mara, Boma, Tusker, Askershus, Cape May \u2013 all very good. Tips are not included. Parks get crowded even now. Some lines are quite fast, some not so much. Use fastpass when you can. As a resort guest you get to go a little earlier and stay a little later beyond opening and closing hours. Use the maps, plan your route. Kids get tired, not a lot of shaded seating.

The entire hotel was BEAUTIFUL - I didn't even feel like I was in Florida - it felt like I was truly in Africa. So gorgeous and there were people playing live music - it was just beautiful. The lobby is HUGE, by the way. We proceeded to check-in where a nice woman told us our room was not yet ready (expected, since it was so early). I asked her if we could have a free upgrade to savanna view since we only had a standard view. She asked us if we would settle for a savanna view w/ 2 queen beds, but we were set on our king size bed, so we passed, but I was happy to see they were going to give us a free upgrade! (Paying for a savanna view isn't completely worth it - there weren't THAT many animals, but when there were, it was nice to see.) She told us she would text me when our room was ready so we headed to the pool, which was SO NICE! It's basically empty this time of year at Disney so it was nice and quiet to relax. The zero-depth entry pool was so cool and different and definitely a great place to tan or to watch your little ones splash around. The bar near the pool was also great and everyone was very friendly. We decided to eat at The Mara (quick service) because we were starving. I don't usually expect much from quick service places, but this is Disney, so it was fantastic! Great burgers and fries and you can even buy beer which I didn't think you could do. Only about an hour later did I receive a text that our room was ready and we headed right to it! What a great room - so much better than in the pictures. African-inspired decor EVERYWHERE. The bathrooms were very small, but all you really have to do is shower and use the toilet, since the two sinks are outside the bathroom, so not many complaints there. The ONLY con I would give AKL is that besides the fact it takes about 20 minutes to get to every park (besides AK), the bus stops at Kidani Village first to pick up and first to drop off (except the Downtown Disney bus). Our first night, we were coming back from EPCOT very late at night and it was raining. The bus stopped at AKL and we got off. Little did we realize we were not at Jambo House. Instead of waiting for another bus (could take 20 minutes), we walked the 10 minutes to Jambo House. This was annoying because no one made an announcement where we were and several other guests got off accidentally, as well. Yet, the next night, there was an announcement as to where we were. In this aspect, Disney should get their stuff together and notify us where we are. People are paying a lot to stay here and an announcement isn't THAT hard. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat!

But the African masks, artifacts, hanging African inspired lamps from an incredibly high ceiling are really impressive. The placement of sofas and chairs in little groupings was also very nicely done. The Jiko restaurant has wonderful food and great ambiance. And of course, it is a thrill to see animals grazing on the savannah surrounding the hotel, although they were not as many or as varied as the last time we stayed here. The room price we paid for a savannah view room in April was almost $500 including tax etc. This time, we saw animals from the room, but from a distance. Last time it seemed as if they had a truck with food that left food which of course attracted the animals to the areas adjacent to savannah view rooms and to the promontory located at the rear of the hotel accessible from the lobby. This time, it seemed the animals may or not graze in view. Many times they were off in the distance. Certainly, something we don't see at home, but not what we expected and not we saw the last time we were there. The room itself was somewhat cramped with two Queen size beds and a small balcony with a bistro table and two chairs. Staff was friendly, but it seemed to me that they were not as friendly as in years past. They were not unfriendly, but I got the f feeling they may be overloaded with work. Just my impression and my husband's as well. We ate at the Kidani Village, the newer hotel facility, and found the cuisine a bit spicy for our taste.

Loved the decor, the beds and amenities. Kids adored the pool. It was not so remote - we were able to return to the room every afternoon for a swim / nap. Bus service to the parks was easy and didn't take too long (but it was \"spring break\" season, when the buses presumably run more frequently). The animals made regular showings -- afternoon is a good time to see them, which works well with an afternoon nap itinerary. The Boma buffet had good offerings for all palates, even for a self-confessed \"foodie\". Make reservations well in advance (like at least a month). It would have been a dream stay had our room not been \"liberated\" of our digital SLR camera that my husband had brought along for his business trip to Gainesville after the vacation.

This review applies to both stays. The property is absolutely gorgeous. Both times we had a savanna view room, in different areas of the property. We had no kids in our group, but we absolutely loved having the savanna view. The animals are typically up early, so by the time you get up there will already be a giraffe or something right outside your window. Great way to start a morning at Disney. Like others have said, the rooms are average size, to small. But they were clean, and of course the look of the room was in the style of the resort. As we were 3 adults, of course it would've been nice to have a slightly larger room, but since it was clean and since weren't in our room very often, we could overlook it. The walk-up restaurant, the Mara, is your typical Disney style one. Grab and go breakfast items (some hot), then burgers, etc for lunch and dinner. Definitely buy one of the mugs for $12 or so -- free refills at the resort, but not in the parks. While I didn't eat at the nicer restaurant on the property, Jiko, the other members of my party did and they said it was fantastic. We didn't use the pools, but we enjoyed walking around and checking everything out. The pools looked nice. As for the bus ride and wait times -- this definitely depends on what time of year you're there. As I said we were there in 2 different Octobers, and both times the ride and wait times weren't bad. Some times we'd be the only ones on the bus, after waiting only a few minutes. Then the next time we'd have to wait 15 minutes, only to see an already-full bus arrive. More often than not, it wouldn't be bad. I'm sure it's worse in more peak times. Those in our group were on slightly different flight schedules, so we were put on different buses.

It was great. We booked a room overooking the Savanna. The room had bunk beds for the girls so no fighting about having to sleep with a restless three year old. We could see animals right off our balcony (typically in the early morning/late afternoon). The room was not spacious (but I have never stayed in a \"spacious\" room at Disney). However, it was clean and we had enough room to hang out. The heated pool was nice with the zero entry, making it great for the 3 year old. We had no issues with getting to the parks. We typically lined up for the bus between 7:15-7:30 and we were at the park gates before they opened. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a return. Because AKL is situated rather remotely, drop offs and pickups were not combined with any other facility (except, strangely, the bus to Hollywood Studios also stopped at Blizzard Beach, which was closed for renovations). The food was very very good at the high end restaurant -- Jiko; okay at the buffet restaurant (name I can't remember) and rather unmemorable at the walk up restaurant, which tends to be the Disney tradition for walk up restaurants. I continue to be lukewarm about Disney - I haven't quite discovered the magic -- crowds were huge after about 11 am; no chance to be spontaenous with dining options; after awhile having fun feels forced, but my girls had a good time. The only truly \"unmagical\" experience I had was with the Airline Transport counter at the lodge, where they provide boarding passes. They provided the passes for my husband, me, and the ten year old, but she couldn't find the three year old in the system. Rather than explain that there must be some sort of glitch in the system, she reasoned that we must have made the three year old's reservation separately and told me to call Delta.

Beds were comfortable, pillows were very small. We could lower thermostat to desired temperature, unlike in the value or moderate hotels. I guess if you pay more for the room, you don't have to conserve energy. All in all, the room was nice, the atmosphere made up for any short comings. Two big negatives. The food court and the bus service. The AKL food court had less choices than the value hotel food courts. Definitely not as good as the Coronado's. The bus service was by far the worse of any Disney hotel that we have stayed. Waits were long and buses were always packed. Bus to animal kingdom took forever and was crowded. Would have been much quicker to drive ourselves. AKL is a beautiful hotel, but you can save a lot of money by staying at a value resort and viewing animals at Animal Kingdom.

The Animal Kingdom Lodge is an impressive property. The visual design is impressive and the hotel has a nice feel. The kids loved the animals being soo close to the property and right outside of the windows. The room was always clean. That being said, the room and property have a number of little problems that add up. First major problem, room service. We elected to get room service during 2 of our nights. The first time we attempted room service we were on hold for 45 minutes. We gave up and tried the front desk for some assistance. We were told that this is par for the course at night and to continue to hold. We gave up and just ordered pizza from a delivery place. The second time we were on hold for 25 minutes. For a \"Deluxe\" hotel this is simply not acceptable. Having stayed at plenty of true \"deluxe\" hotels (i.e. Ritz, JW Marriott, Hyatt Regency, etc) this just does not measure up. Second problem, room size. We had a pool view room. The room was nicely decorated but it was small for a \"deluxe\" hotel. We had family stay at one of the \"value\" hotels during our stay and our room was not much larger than theirs. While the double sinks were nice, the room is tight. Most Hilton Garden Inn rooms are larger than the rooms at the Lodge. Third, the pool. First, we personally didn't have any incidents at the pool. However, during our one day at the pool we witnessed almost two drownings right under the lifeguard's nose. The lifeguard was busy chatting while two small children on two different occassions found themselves underwater and in trouble. I'm not about to remove parental responsibility, however the lifeguard was clearly caught with his pants down as strangers came to the rescue I don't want you to walk away with the impression that this is not a nice property.

Some people wrote there was no place to put their luggage the beds were high enough off the floor to store them under the beds or under the sinks. The rooms were very clean so I felt good about putting them on the floor. We paid for a standard room at the Jambo house but got a great view of all the animals. There was a feeder for the giraffes right out from our balcony!! I also read that people thought the bus rides took forever or got off at the wrong stop. The Magic Kingdom was the futherest park but it only took about 20 minutes to get there to me that's not that big of a deal. Now for getting off at the wrong stop then they just were not listening. The driver will annouce which stop it is there are only 2. Either you are in Jambo house or at the Kidani Village. 90% of the time they went to the villas first. So all you have to do is pay attention. The last day we were there we went over to the Kidani Village to check it out, we found washer and dryers there which would have been good to know since we have a 3 year old who loved the ice cream at the parks.So needless to say we ran out of shirts for her.

I have to say that overall the hotel was amazing! We had not planned to stay in a Savannah View Room but, thanks to our request for a birthday button, were upgraded at check-in. Our view was of the Sunset Savannah and we saw animals all hours of the day and night. Watching the animals was fascinating, we were on the 2nd floor which turned out to be the perfect level, and it was very difficult for us to leave the balcony. When staying here in the future, a Savannah View Room will be a must! We ate breakfast a Bomo every morning of our stay and very much enjoyed the experience. And, blessed by excellent weather, we were able to spend two afternoons at the pool! A tip: there are lounge chairs on the backside of the pool, behind the cabana, that face the Savannah\u2026layout here, the view is much better. You can lay by a pool and watch sunbathers anywhere, but I\u2019d never sunbathed with a giraffe before! Everyone at the resort was friendly and accommodating, be sure to take time to chat with the Savannah Guides, they are full of info about the animals on the Savannahs and their homelands. I have to share that although the overall experience was wonderful there was one big negative, the bus service. The bus service was the worst I had ever experienced and this was at least my 10th stay at a Disney Resort in the past 5 years. We waited 40 minutes on the first morning that we were there for a bus to the Animal Kingdom. By the end of our trip we had resorted to catching a cab to and from the parks, which seems very unnecessary to me as I have used Disney transportation often in the past without any issues of long wait times.

My husband, three sons (8, 6, 2 yrs.), parents, and I all travelled together from Ottawa. I love WDW (we've been before but never with the grandparents) and hoped that this would be the trip of a lifetime, but there were a number of little \"hiccups\" once we arrived. I won't bore you with all the details - mistakes were made but the staff were courteous and upgraded our room. The lobby and guest rooms are beautiful- exactly like the pictures. The housekeeping was excellent. The pool, hot tubs, and waterslide were also excellent. My boys enjoyed seeing the animals on the savannah, but to be honest, I didn't find it overly impressive. Usually, there weren't many animals out there. Two smaller complaints that our group had was the lack of WiFi (from Hubby and Grandpa) and lack of hand cream (Grandma thought it would automatically be there with the soaps in the bathroom). My biggest problem with the AKL was the bus service to the parks. We have stayed at a number of other Disney resorts over the years and AKL was new to us. What I didn't realize when booking our holiday, was that the location of the resort means that we would have to endure about a 30 minute bus ride to and then from the parks each day (not including the wait times for the bus). The busses are clean and the drivers are friendly (what else would you expect at Disney?) and they come every 20 min., but when added up over the course of the week, we would have preferred to stay at a monorail resort. We stayed on-site so that we could come back to our hotel in the afternoon for some down time, however the bus ride dissuaded us from doing this, making it a more tiring trip than it should have been. My husband began timing the bus rides. It took us 40 minutes to get to Downtown Disney one morning. Our favourite parks are MK and Epcot, which are furthest from the AKL, so next time, we'll try the Grand Floridian. I read TripAdvisor many times while planning our trip, so I thought I should pass this little tidbit on because I didn't read this complaint before and I didn't think the location of the resort would have mattered as much.

The computer system went down moments before our turn at the desk. Without the computer, the Front Desk was basically helpless. Not enough people to do it manually. They could not check room availability, issue room keys or even check our reservations. Nada. After 30 minutes of no service, a back office person came by and explained it was a problem with an indefinite down time. After an hour of this, the desk clerk took our phone number and told us to go have dinner and bring the receipt. So, off to dinner. After walking around for a while (too early to eat initially), we went over to the Boma buffet. Since we did not have a reservation, we settled down for what we thought would be a long wait as people with reservations surged ahead of us. Well, about ten minutes after we got there the dinner reservation system went down and they had to write down names and times on a note pad. We had told them we did not have a reservation, but with the system down, and working off of note pads, they just took whoever was there. We got in within a few minutes. $95 worth of dinner later we left and sure enough they paid for it. They also gave us two attractions \"Priority Passes\" to go to the head of the line at one ride at a park, but we did not need them. No big crowds in February. Note: the buffet has a lot of different food types that are fun to try but may not be something you want every day. We had \u201cupgraded\u201d to a pool view, but the room was near an inside corner and the pool was barely visible way off to the right through some trees. Not close to the grand view I saw in the web site photo gallery. Oddly enough I am certain they had rooms available with much better views - the place was not crowded at all, so I don\u2019t understand why they felt compelled to put us there. I guess they reserve those great view rooms for those who complain, or pay full price. We did neither. I was not in the mood to complain. After being roomless for three and a half hours, we just wanted to find a place to park ourselves. The room was fine. We also availed ourselves of the Bell service. For a few dollars in tips, it saves a lot of hassle. Turns out there was an unintended benefit to our corner room. We were only a few hallway steps away from a gorgeous overlook that gave us a great view of the Savannah area. The space was large, with several comfortable rocking chairs. Much more comfortable than the cramped confines of a balcony room with those small metal chairs. Next time, we\u2019ll get a standard view and just walk to a savannah overlook when we want to see the animals. That was really nice. Giraffes, Thompson\u2019s Gazelle's and many other interesting animals wandered around just yards away from the overlook. Jinko was an excellent, pricey restaurant. We ate there the second night. Yet, again, we found ourselves treated in a minimalist way. We were ushered to a table right next to the service area used by the waiters. Seemed odd to put us there when there were many better located unused tables set elsewhere. I guess you have to speak up aggressively to get better service, but for what we\u2019re spending on the dinner and for what they advertise in service, that should not be necessary. At that level of service, you should not be expected to request special treatment \u2013 it should be taken for granted. Access to the parks was all by Bus. Not a big issue except take care on the return. The bus says \u201cAnimal Kingdom Lodge\u201d, but it makes an extra stop at another Animal Kingdom Lodge before it gets to the main Hotel lodge. After a long tired day, we were only half listening to the canned voice so when we got to the familiar stop, we just got off and only after the bus left did we realize our error. The two places look very similar, particularly at night, but they are very different. You do not stop there on the way out. Took an extra 20 minutes to get to our place. Oh well. Overall, we will return to AKL. It was really nice and grew on us as we stayed. Lots of little corners and alcoves to discover and \u201chang out\u201d in and relax in relative seclusion and peace. Service was very kind though not always the best, and they try hard to make it a positive experience. They were clearly distraught about the computer issues they were having, but that is something we will all have to get used to everywhere we go. It is not unique to Disney, and when they work, computer systems are fabulous, but when they fail, there is little to no backup. Having been visiting Disney parks off and on for decades (I live one hour away) I notice changes on occasion. One new Customer Service technique I noticed they have gotten down really well is conversation. When you find you have to spend time with one of their employees, say waiting on a ticket, or a bus, or just hanging out, they will strike up friendly conversations with you about what you are enjoying and plan to do, and about things they like to do and suggest ideas to augment your own experience.

We always stay at a different on-site hotel to keep up on things. Because I have a class coming up in March, and since we had not stayed at AKL since just after it opened, we decided to stay for an extended weekend from 2/04 to 2/09. Our flight out of Chicago got us to the hotel shortly before noon, and we had previously used the on-line check-in service. When our reserved room was not yet ready, we were offered an alternate which was ready. The alternate was a handicapped accessible room and because it was on the same level as the lobby and only four rooms away from the lobby it worked out fine. We had a view over the Sunset Savanna, and were able to view giraffe, zebra, eland, ostrich, and various other fauna, mostly in the late afternoon or early evening. The facilities in the room were much the same as I remembered from our earlier stay, and the service, etc. was generally up to Disney standards. We had breakfast and dinner in the Boma restaurant which was great. The Mara quick-service restaurant was fine for breakfast on the other days. Other meals were taken either at the theme parks, at Downtown Disney, or at the other hotels. Because we always rent a car at the airport, access to the major theme parks was not problem. We did not take any of the Disney buses, having learned our lesson about commuting times in the past. My only real complaint was the lack of wifi in the hotel. Recent trips around the US and throughout Europe, we were almost always able to check email, etc., via my laptop which is always with me. At AKL, I had to rely on my phone for receiving emails, but i have found it much more difficult to respond on a smart phone (my fingers are too big for the keyboard, and I'm too old to be able to use only my thumbs like my grand kids do). I mean, come on this is the 21st century. So, our stay was comfortable, but we have always enjoyed the WDW hotels.

Fabulous! It was our first time at Disney World and wanted to stay on property. We all loved the room. We had a two bedroom unit with three bathrooms. There was a king bed in the \"master\" bedroom and two queen size beds in the second bedroom. Our children and our grandson were very happy in the \"other\" bedroom. Both bedrooms have ceiling fans as well as the living area. We did not have a savanah view room, but we really did not find that to be any problem at all. The beds/pillows were very comfortable for all parties. We loved the layout as the living area separates the two bedroom areas and they could be closed off for complete privacy when necessary. The kitchen was nicely appointed and to our surprise, we had a washer and dryer in the room, so we did not need to carry clothes to the common area laundry (which was lovely) but know one had to be away from the family for laundry chores. They also provide a recycle can in the room, as well as a trash container. We stopped on our way for groceries and got in around noon and our room was not due to be ready til 4 p.m. The staff was wonderful and provided containers and refrigeration for our groceries til the room was ready. Which, by the way, was available at 2 p.m. There is a small, but nicely stocked, store at Kidani, but expect to pay a lot more for what you need. The main + for the Disney properties is Convenience, convenience, convenience. Park your car if you have one; and walk down the hall to the sheltered bus area and go to the park of your choice. Leave the park, walk to the bus area and back to the resort you go. Before we left, I read lots of reviews that the AKL was so far from everything and that is indeed true, however, it never took longer than 20-30 minutes on the bus from the farthest point. Do keep that in mind with little children, but our grandson is 5 and he was never antsy about the bus ride - either way. The pool area is great with a nice area for the little ones and a very nice hot tub as well. There is a community room where the children can do crafts or color; play games like foose ball and WII and pool and the staff there are great. The activities in this room are free. There is also an arcade (this costs money of course) but they have some great things there and both of these places are great for the times it might be raining or in the evenings if you don't have the omph for more Disney parks. There are many wonderful \"viewing\" areas for the sighting of animals on the savanah. Even though we did not have a savanah view there is a lovely balcony which spans both bedrooms and the living area...great for morning coffee and a little reading before you start the day. The restaurant in Kidani is very nice and we were lucky enough to have lunch there while they were feeding the animals and it was wonderful. There are two additional restaurants at Jamba House. You can walk, which they say is a 9 minute walk, but we all walked over together and it didn't seem very long at all. If you are not up to the walk though, they run a little shuttle van from Kidani to Jamba and back. Jamba also has a much larger store as well. I cannot say enough about the staff - and how knowledgeable and accomodating they are - and the accomodations. It is a lovely place indeed. My only negative is that it is dark - dimly lit - and if you want any time in your room to watch a little TV, there is not much to choose from except Disney commercials and info channels.

I guess I did notice the bed a little creeky, but come on people its not that serious. Boma was awesome and their quick service good as well. I was most concerned about the commute from the resort to Magical Kingdom, but honestly for us it wasn't a big deal. We waited maybe 10 minutes for the bus and the drive took 25 minutes max. It gave us a chance to map out our day and once again it was not worth the extra money just to pay for location. Bottom Line- If you want want of the deluxe resorts AKL is an awesome choice.

Since we were taking our niece (14) and nephew (9) as their Christmas gift we decided to upgrade and pay the premium for a savannah view. Our double queen room was clean and nicely outfitted, however, a bit on the small side. The bathroom had a double sink with a very small separate toilet/shower area. The lighting in the shower area was extremely dim. The \u201csavannah\u201d view from our balcony was definitely not as impressive as we had hoped. Our balcony overlooked a very dry/barren land area with a few trees and a watering hole. During our stay, we only saw a few zebras, a water buffalo and one distant sighting of a giraffe. This was a disappointment as we had hoped to see a lot more animals from our balcony. The beds were comfortable but, as another reviewer had mentioned, extremely squeaky and noisty. This was a huge problem because anytime that someone moved in their bed we could hear a loud creaking noise. The beds have large wooden frames so I guess it\u2019s the internal structure causing this noise. In addition, we were shocked that the resort does not have Wi-Fi and the only TV stations available are owned by Disney. TBS, USA, TNT, etc. are not available. Pay per view movies are not available. The pool area was fantastic - great little pool bar and plenty of life guards staffed all around the pool. It was cool during our stay but the pool water was warm for all to enjoy. The gym at the hotel had plenty of cardio machines and free weights. We dined at Jiko one night and had a fabulous meal. The restaurant is pricey and portions are small but service and ambience was nice which made for an enjoyable dining experience. The lobby of Animal Kingdom is gorgeous and spacious with lots of earth tones, dim lighting and seating areas. There is also an indoor and outdoor firepit for guests to enjoy. The only other \u201cissue\u201d is that the room service menu is very limited for children. The resort only offer 4/5 choices for children and does not have the typical pizza, hot dog, chicken nuggets that are popular with anyone under the age of 12. We had pizza delivered to our room one night from an outside restaurant (Flippers) which worked out really well. The bar at the hotel is really nice with very personable staff and great service. There is no food service at the bar but you can order off the room service menu and they will deliver to your bar seat/table. We did not try out the breakfast or dinner buffet \u2013 however, both were packed solid whenever we went by them. Overall service and hospitality at the resort was top notch!!

My biggest complaint is about the beds. Usually I can sleep pretty much anywhere and the beds are not super important to me. But these were hard, squeaky and uncomfortable.

On a previous trip to Orlando we stayed at the Marriott Village. We stayed on property since we were only there for a quick weekend and knew the destinations we wanted to hit for the kids. Not being hard core Disney people, the entire operation is a bit overwhelming - from the mass transit, to the retail sales, to the theme parks. The kids had a ball. Animal Kingdom Lodge was beautiful - well maintained, clean, beautiful pool and grounds. We had no trouble with our stay in the hotel and made it quickly via Disney bus transit to all our destinations. Our major issue with this trip was the Magical Express transporation to/from the airport. If you travel a lot, I would highly recommend your own airport transportation as this was enough to drive me crazy. It took us 2.5 hours upon landing to get to our room. We had to be on the bus back to the airport 3 hours ahead of flight time. It was neither magical nor express in my opinion. Many activities at Disney feel like cattle car types of events - mass crowds moving one direction and then to another. While not our style, the kids did enjoy themselves. Questionable value for this facility comes from the price tag associated with the hotel and the benefits received. We stayed in a similar type of room (queen bed, bunk beds) in the Marriott Village for about $125 less per night and had just as good of accomodation and service. While the ambiance is far superior at the lodge, and the transportation to and from the parks was convenient, you have to forgo any kind of value seeking frame of mind you may have when going to Disney.

We loved the hotel and its atmosphere and were very pleased with guest services. Before arrival, I was somewhat worried about the bus situation because of reviews written previously about long waits for disney buses as well as long trips to the parks, especially Magic Kingdom. I am very pleased to say that we did not encounter any of these problems. We were told that the buses run every 20 minutes and we found this to pretty much be true. Also, our trip to Magic Kingdom took us only 30 minutes. Now I know this may because we went during a less busy time of year but even at other times of the year we must remember that the Disney property is very large and that when it comes to the bus situation it probably wouldn't be that much quicker even if you were going park to park in a car. We were very happy with our room at AKL as well. We had a standard view room as it was cheaper and we knew we wouldn't be in the room long enough anyways to worry about whether we had a good view or not. If you do not have a view of the animals you can easily walk around the hotel where there are viewing areas where you can see the animals up close and personal. There are also knowledgeable guides who will tell you about their native land of Africa and about the animals as well. Back to our room, our beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows for the 3 of us. There was an extra blanket in the closet so that was nice when the nights got cold. Having 3 women in one room, we were very happy that the sink area (and 2 sinks at that) was separate from the shower area. That made it nice when we were all getting ready at the same time in the mornings. We did not take much advantage of the food at AKL. We ate breakfast a few times in the quick service area and it was very substantial and good. We found all three of us could get by on one full adult breakfast everyday therefore not using up 3 counter service meals at one time. There was a coffee pot in the room so there was no reason to waste your beverage allotment on a cup of coffee. (Just a little tip I realized after the first day so thought I would pass it on) All in all this was an amazing hotel and if and when I returned to DisneyWorld I would most certainly stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cOverall a very good hotel, but some improvements noted.\u201d", "Author": "busterjosh", "ReviewID": "UR93275254", "Content": "As I write this review, I am sitting in my room at Disneys AKL. I am a frequent traveler and return visitor to Disney. Last year we stayed at Port Orleans French Quarter which was AWESOME in every way. This year we decided to upgrade to Deluxe at AKL. Overall, this is an amazing property. The lobby is grand and impressive. There are many animal viewing areas and an overall african theme everywhere. The pool is immense and there are plenty of activities to entertain the children. However, the quick service restaurant is badly in need of an upgraded menu. Currently there are 2 salads, 2 pizzas and hamburgers on the menu. We were desperate for protein after the second day and took the bus to Port Orleans French Quarter to get a decent meal. I don't think you would have trouble if you have the standard dining plan. However, if you opyt for quick servcie this is not the resort for you. Another thing to keep in mind is that a trip to magic kingdom is approx 45 mins and downtown disney is at least 30 mins due to the location of the hotel.

Our room had a balcony overlooking the savannah and there were giraffe, impala, zebra, waterbuck, kudu, ostrich and more grazing just below us.

The lodge and the grounds were stunning. Paid for a Standard View, but were placed in room in 2547 which, if you look at a map, isn't technically a savannah, but let me say that I am certain we saw more animals than anyone else. We regularly had giraffe, zebra, wildabeast, and several other animals on a regular basis. Some standard views indeed have no view, but honestly - it's worth booking a standard as many people seem to get upgrades or animal views anyway. If you don't get the upgrade, there are numerous viewing areas to see the animals. I honestly don't feel that paying for anything other than a standard view is worth it. We stayed in one of the furthest rooms from the lobby. The walk was 3-3/12 minutes max, depending on how tired I was. I mention this because people have complained about the long walk. 3.5 minutes after walking MILES all day at Disney? Really? Come on people. The hotel was immaculate, as was our room. Each day our room was as clean, neat and tidy as the day we arrived. We did leave a $5 tip every morning, but I'm sure the room would have been cleaned just the same. So long as we're talking about tipping housekeeping - please do it. Those people work HARD and make so little. It was a $35 added expense to our overall trip that I feel was totally worth it. You tip a bellman who wheels your luggage to your room with ease, why not the person on their hands and knees cleaning your toilet, vacuuming your floors and doing the backbreaking work of making bed after bed after bed all day. Just a thought. For $5 a day you can really make someone's day who really deserves it. Anyway...my only complaint was drawer space. There were exactly 2 drawers in the room, in the armoire that housed the TV. I used one for me, and one for my daughter. The hubby lived out of the suitcase all week. Honestly, there wasn't really room for another dresser so yeah, the rooms are a little small...but nothing that should deter you from staying here. Just keep this in mind if you are staying a week or more and have 4 people in the room. Could be a bit crowded with space for your things. BOMA - Yum! This is the on-site buffet restaurant. We loved it, as did my parents who were also there. Definitely not African food, but perhaps African Inspired. Amazing soups, salad bar, hummus bar and desert bar. Great side dishes. I don't eat meat, but the meat eaters at the table seem really pleased with what was offered. Expensive, so - as I'd recommend to anyone - I don't know if it is worth the money if you are not on the dining plan. Speaking of which, it is a GREAT value so long as you are really into sit down dining on vacation. If you are happy with quick service burgers and sandwiches all week, you may be better off without. Anyway, do the math before you commit. JIKO - We didn't eat here as it was 2 dinner credits with our dining plan, but it has a wonderful reputation. If we didn't have a small child with us who simply wouldn't have appreciated the food for the price, we would have eaten there anyway. The staff was great...but I wouldn't call them \"magical.\" I could see the frustration on the guys face at registration when I asked several times how a 3 person 8 day upgrade to park hopper could be over $250 when in my head it was nearly $100 less. When he finally sighed and pulled out his calculator he saw that I was right and quickly corrected it. But it's Disney, man...try not to look like your guest is being a pain in the a$$. On the other hand, I saw some really rude people in line and so I can see where they can get fried in the course of a day. Whatever. Yep, it is further from the Magic Kingdom than any place else. About a 10-15 minute bus ride from the resort. We may consider staying at the Contemporary or Polynesian the next time if the cost is on par with Animal Kingdom - but if it is much more expensive as it was at our time of booking, it isn't worth it in my opinion. The pool is gorgeous, great for little ones as you can walk in and gradually get deeper. At night, just past the pool on the side of the building, you can use night vision goggles to watch the animals. This happens around 9pm. Super.

On arrival, we stored our bags as it was early morning, fresh off of a Disney Cruise. When we returned, after a long day at Animal Kingdom, all the rooms were under my name (we had a group of 16, with four rooms), all of the baggage was delivered to my room which was a wonderful suite at the end of one of the hallway branches in Jambo House. I was a the desk giving the credit card information and getting the keys. (First glich was that I had spent over a half an hour on line during the Disney Cruise \"checking in\"....costing me computer time on the ship...this was supposed to allow me to just pick up my keys on arrival.....but not so....even tho I told the man at the front desk, he had to take my card and do EACH room individually which took some time to do the ...not to mention he money that I had wasted with computer time on the ship). So back to the baggage......I arrived at our room to find the bellman leaving and 16 plus bags both inside and OUTSIDE of our room. I caught the bellman and asked him if he could just take the bags of my daughter's family to their room as I now had the room number....she has four children, some young, who could not handle their bags. I was truly flabbergasted as the porter continued on his way and said that it was just down the hall (a LONG hall) and around the corner. He might have been tired out from all the bags but I have never seen such a thing. He left his rubber stopper in the door to hold the door open!! My husband wanted to tip him but did not even have a chance as the porter was so flustered (we ALWAYS tip and could not believe his hurry). So those were the first two \"strikes\" in our book......We DID love the hotel......we saw so much wildlife out of our window and it was a perfect place to end our two week vacation. We had no problem with the buses......just depends on your luck, I think.....one day it right there and the next we had to wait a little while....no problem for us. We were on concierge floor and found this to be just perfect as our big group could all eat breakfast before we headed out to the park. The concierge food is on the sixth floor and we were on the fourth floor....it is tricky to get up there and we would have appreciated someone telling us that it took a special elevator, but we figured it out eventually. We also ate at Boma and it was very wonderful.....the most delicious buffet ever......so many unusual things, but they were all very inviting and tasty. We had a long standing reservation for our group of 16 but were given a pager on our arrival at the restaurant....we did have to wait at least a half an hour....could add that to the negative column but I understand with a group that large, it is not always easy. Another strange cast member happening was that on both nights loud knocks brought us to our doors to find maids who offered to turn down our beds at anywhere from 8 to 9:30 p.m.!!.....long after some little ones in our party were asleep. The night before we left I went to the check out desk to see about printing our boarding passes and finding out more about checking our baggage on though to our home as was advertised by the Magical Express bus service to the airport. The lady told me to come back the next day, early in the morning, to avoid the crowds later, which we did. I had signed up for a premiere baggage option with United Airlines which allowed me to check 16 bags for free, which was a great savings for this trip. I bought all of the enrollment paperwork with me to make sure I would have no problems.....the program was all attached to my mileage plus number. The lady at the airline desk, Denise, was very brusk and even tho I showed her my paperwork she said she could NOT check my bags. She told me my only option was to go and do my own check in on their computer which is \"Hidden\" behind the front desk area.....guests can use it but you have to be let in through locked doors. She said I would have to take all the bags with me on the bus. Since I had 16 people to check in for the flight, this took some time.......during my time in the computer room, and there was NO one else waiting.....a cast member came by to tell me that there is a 15 minute time limit on the computer.....hummm...let me see, I guess that was strike 4, however I would l iike to give Denise several strikes!! I finally finished the airport check in and printing of boarding passes when my husband and a very NICE man, named Ron, a cast member who had witnessed the whole thing, came to get me and told me that they WOULD now check our baggage as they had checked on my premier baggage membership and had found that I was telling the truth:) This is what they should have done in the first place. So happily, with the help of Ron and another nice employee, Wilberto, who had taken me to the computer room...and was very sympathetic, we DID finally check our baggage all the way through, they took the bags from us, a great help....and the Magical Express was indeed magical! Denise seemed to try to \"make nice\" when they were taking our bags......putting all the bags receipts on a paper for me and telling me that I should write everyones name on the tags so I would know who they belonged to if one went missing ??? this while they were loading the bags on a cart......didn't make sense to me as if one was missing, I would have been able to tell by seeing which ones arrived safely ...but oh well.......she asked me if I had printed my boarding passes and when I said yes, she dramatically ripped the ones that she was in the process of printing in half and mumbled something about wasting her time:) I did feel I had to make mention of all these mishaps from the staff......but hope that you will give it a try it you are dreaming of going here, because it is a very special hotel........with a few glitches......I am glad we had the experience of staying there, when all is said and done!

The dates we selected were great because it was not crowded, we were able to visit all the parks an ride all the atractions, the longest wait time for an atraction was 1.5 hour and we used fast pass on this so we only waited in line about 15 min. We notified the hotel that it was our aniversary so they gave us a pin for us to wear in our stay and the staff all around the complex would congratulate us, it was a really nice feeling. The hotel is very pretty, of course is a themed hotel and its all africa all around, the walk to the room is ok, it is not soooo big that you have to walk your feet off to get to the room, it is very accesible. We did not tried the restaurants because we were in the parks all evenings, but we use to wake up late and get to the parks at noon, and the sleep in morning hours was great, it is not noisy and its peacefull. Room was a little bit small, but is comfortable, and the bathroom is veery preetty, and you receive all kind of details around the room like towel art. The pool was pretty and good sized.

Because we stayed at this level and at this resort we had access to a number of extra experiences (at an extra cost). They were all amazing opportunities to get closer too and learn a lot more about the animals at the lodge and at the park. We did the dinner safari at the lodge (requires staying at the lodge); we did the sunrise safari at the park (requires staying at the lodge at concierge level) and the backstage tour of the safari ride at the park (requires concierge level at any resort). The Animal Kingdom Lodge is a beautiful resort and the proximity to the animals is a huge bonus. We find it to be quieter for some reason. There are still kids here (it is Disney) - but it was calmer than the monorail resorts (GF, Poly, Contemporary). The decor is beautiful. Our rooms were always clean, we had a new towel animal every day, the restaurants are great - Jiko is amazing. If you don't drive yourself (and I recommend Disney transportation) you will take a bus to the parks. While this resort is the furthest away from most parks - the buses only stop at the Villas (first) and the hotel (Jambo House) - the two areas that make up this property. So you quickly get to the parks. One person we met at a lunch was staying at the Contemporary and while it was great for getting to Magic Kingdom & Epcot - her bus stopped at FOUR more resorts before it got to Hollywood Studios - it took a long time and was cramped. Except for coming back at park closing - we never had a super crowded bus at all. If you stay here build time into your trip to enjoy the resort. Wander to different viewing stations (and your balcony) and see the animals. Go out at night and sit by the bonfire or see the animals with night vision goggles!

Typically, we find ourselves traveling to Orlando once every year or two and have always enjoyed our stay within the Walt Disney World property. So we were excited about staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge Jambo House (the hotel, not the time shares at Kidani Village), one of the few luxury resorts we have never stayed in. First, the positives. The hotel overall is beautifully done. Dark wood tones, native art adorning many of the areas throughout the hotel create a perfect impression of Africa. We were enthralled with the animals outside most of the public viewing areas. In most regards, Disney World more than delivered on its marketing promises for general viewing. We also can't say enough about how incredible the food is throughout the hotel. Boma, the buffet is probably the most inventive and appealing buffets we have ever tried. The fine dining restaurant, Jiko, is perhaps the best of any of Disney\"s restaurants. It was an absolutely PERFECT meal. We went back a second night. The down side....and there are many negative areas. First, the rooms. We booked a savannah view and quickly found out that represents a BROAD category. The first room we were assigned was overlooking a muddy 40 yard area enclosed with a chain link fence....more construction zone than savannah. If you do not have a room facing the inner circle, the viewing is very limited and rather poor. Typically smaller than most of the luxury resort rooms, the rooms are also very very very poorly lit. Two inadaqute sconces plus one floor lamp are the only lighting in the room. It was impossible to read at night. The bathroom sink and counter are open to the main room and feels more Days Inn and less luxury resort. The overall feeling is cramped and claustrophobic. We actually tried to book another hotel within Disney and unfortunately, all were already booked. We would have left the hotel if we had a choice. Lastly, when things go well at Disney, great, but if not......there is very little the staff are empowered to change or correct. Even small issues presented a challenge for the front desk. It wasn't that they didnt try, it was more they didn't know how or weren't empowered to create a solution. We can only say that after two days, we were desperate to change hotels and sorry we had ever booked the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I can only offer that rather than stay at the Lodge, take an afternoon, go over and see the lobby and perhaps have a meal and go back to one of the other resorts.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay at Disney\u201d", "Author": "dec49", "ReviewID": "UR89948129", "Content": "We loved Animal Kingdom Lodge-Jambo House. It was busy, but did not seem crowded. There were plenty of places to sit and relax inside and out. The huge lobby had several small groups of comfortable chairs and couches, a large gas fire pit, large windows overlooking the savannah, and an exceptional gift shop. Outside were pathways to animal viewing areas, and rocking chairs around another fire pit. The quick service dining, the Mara, the arcade, the fitness center, and the beautiful pool were accessible outside on the lower level. The restaurants (Boma is recommended highly) and the lounge were also on the lower level (stairs or elevator). We did not have any long waits for the busses. In fact it seemed as if other resort lines were much longer. Make sure you get off at the Jambo House exit, not the Village exit. Rooms were nice, nothing really \"luxurious\" and clean. We did not request the savannah view, but saw many animals along the outside overlooks. Cast members were available to answer any questions. We were close to the lobby on the fourth floor. Had the weather been warmer, we would have used the outdoor patio viewing area just down the hallway. The only slight complaint we had the entire stay was the long wait we encountered checking out our luggage at the bell desk. We had requested the service before we left home--it was very convenient, but there was a long line the morning of our departure. Just remember your luggage may not arrive at the hotel when you do, so it you don't want to wait for it (they will deliver it directly to your room), bring what you need in a carry-on, check it at the bell desk, and head off for the park. By the time we had finished lunch, our luggage had already arrived. We used the online check-in service, told them our arrival would be noon, and when we checked in the room was ready.

During that trip, we went to AKL to have dinner at Boma (delicious!). My husband and I decided then that for our next Disney trip we would stay at AKL. We just got back yesterday, and we loved Animal Kingdom Lodge. My top tips are as follows: 1. Spring for a room with a savanna view. We had giraffes, zebras, pelicans, big horned cattle and more right outside our balcony. My husband and I really enjoyed watching the animals every morning. 2. Get the dining plan, make your reservations early, and don't forget to eat at Boma for breakfast, dinner, or both. It is LOVELY to have all of your meals prepaid and not to worry about how much you're spending. 3. Get the Park Hopper tickets - we'd go to one park during the day for rides and another in the evening for dinner and the parade/fireworks. It was wonderful to come back to Animal Kingdom Lodge in the late afternoon to clean up and gear up for dinner. We'd hang out on the balcony, watch the animals, and never feel like we were wasting valuable Disney time by taking a break in our room. 4. Wake up early and get to the parks about 20-30 minutes before they open. Know which rides are on your Must Do list. Send someone from your group to get Fast Passes for one ride, then go wait in line for a different ride. Use fast passes for the big rides, and you will be able to ride everything. We are planning on a Disney Trip every four years, and we will definitely stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge again.

Breathtaking lobby decor. Plenty of access to animal viewing without getting a room facing the Savannah (animal ranges).

Quality African furnishings in the room (refrig was included, no microwave) and just spacious enough considering we were at the parks most of the time. Queen sized beds vs. doubles found at moderate Disney resorts. We were a bit worried that the bus trips to the rest of Disney's properties would be lengthy but they were not (though we visited purposefully during low season). It was 5 min to Animal Kingdom, 15 min to Epcot and Hollywood Studies, 18 min to Magic Kingdom. We waited 10-15 min for buses and were never left to wait for another bus. Lines for buses seemed longer for other resorts than for this lodge. The pool was large enough but the slide seems to be more for the 6 and under crowd, not exactly thrilling.

The check in was excellent, the lady who checked us in was everyhting you expect from disney, friendly and polite. Very informative about the resort and let us know everything we need to know. No mention of ugrades and being a shy englishman i didnt mention anything. She gave us our keys and directed us to the elevator.

The magic then happened, i opened the balcony door and walked out to me met with Giraffe, Zebra, Ostritch and various othger birds and animals. We had been ugraded to a savannah view and what a view it was. Our savannah was always covered in animals no matter what time of the day it was. We spent alot of time sitting on our balcony looking over the savannah, the view alone is worth the money. We both agreed if we went back we would pay the extra for the savannah view, it truly does make for an amazing experience. Transport was generally good, although you are the furthest resort from most of the parks it never took more than 20mins to get anywhere and buses were very regular. Mousekeeping was excellent, towel animals left and always did an excellent job. All other staff we encountered were excellent and i enjoyed speaking to some of them about their African homelands. Pool area was very nice and clean as were the viewing areas. If you get the chance go to one of the viewing ares at night to look through the nightvision. Food options were good.

Otherwise, while busy, you don't feel crowded. The lobby is spectacular, and the African art scattered throughout the hotel was quite interesting. The service was excellent, Disney's trademark, although it appeared to us that Disney is now waiting for a request to fulfill rather than being pro-active. Major initial problem, the 3rd floor (lobby-level) wheelchair room faced the central savannah at eye level with the observation area - not conducive to privacy or relaxing on the bed while viewing the animals. Our prior stay's wheelchair room on the Sunset savannah is now no longer considered savannah-view due to a major increase in an enclosure outside - which removed the close giraffe viewing opportunities we had enjoyed four years ago. The concierge level was helpful, but primarily for Disney activities. The coffee service there ends at 10 PM - with no provision for night owls. Amazingly the only internet option is a fixed Ethernet port at $10 per day. Hotel staff did pass along the possibility of wifi in the lobby area in the coming year, maybe. The pool area was not relaxing: think massive child's swim party with appropriate noise. Along with the Sunrise Safari, the best new option is the use of night-vision scopes after 9PM at the savannah by the pool. Cool to see the green-lit giraffes and other animals.

In general, I do not complain about hotels. I believe that a review should be based on realistic expectations, the actual price that you paid, and factors within the control of the hotel. That being said, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is a terrible value. And, I do not believe that what happened with my stay is unusal. I booked my room for October 2010 back in January. Since I was with a group, I booked it with a Disney coordinator. I paid full price for a Savanah room on the concierge level ($435.00). Here is what we got: We got a small corner room on the fourth floor. This meant that we had no view of the animals because a huge tree was blocking our view. If you have stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, you will know what I am talking about. The building curves and my room was at the end of the curve. The end of the Savanah. In addition, our balcony was very public because there was a public porch directly to the left of our room. There was also a firepit directly under us. If the lack of a view, which I paid $435.00 a night for, was the only thing that I did not get for my money, I may not be so harsh. Why? Because, the Animal Kingdom Lodge can always tell me that they can't control where the animals go. Okay, I'll buy that. I judge a hotel by factors which are under its control. However, it was under the hotel's control to put me in a room which had a dead-on view. As a customer paying full-price, I expect to be given the \"full-price\" room. If I was a frequent customer that had \"elite\" customer benefits, then I would expect the \"upgraded\" room if it was available, if no one paid \"full price\" for a room. But, let's talk about the room itself. Because, I paid full price $435.00 a night, Which meant that I expected perfect service. I had no kleenix in the room. Silly, right? At first, I thought that was normal. I figured it was some sort of \"green\" thing. So, we used toilet paper. The turn-down service was just that: They turned down the bed and left chocolates. They didn't straighten anything up. They didn't update the amenities. Nothing. Just turned down the bed, left chocolates and they left. The last night...they didn't even leave chocolates. And, speaking of just leaving: The cleaning crew left everything. The towels where they were, the dirty plates. Everything. I don't know if it is a Disney thing but they didn't touch anything. Not even to clean it. After day two (2) I figured that if I put everything in a pile in the middle of the floor, the cleaning crew would take it. And, the amenities. Let's talk about them. Oh wait. I can't. During my four-night stay, I got one set. This is when I arrived and that was it. By the last night, we were rationing soap. Thank goodness we travel with our own shampoo. Now, before you start thinking that I was on the phone whining to the manager, think again. I never complained to the manager, not once during my stay. Why? Because, the Animal Kingdom Lodge knew that I was paying $435.00 a night for my room. And, they knew it was sub-standard when they put me in it. The only complaint I made was when I first checked in. I called and verified if this was really my room. I asked them to check. They said yes. I asked if my room had been inspected and they said yes. The woman said that they had \"stringent\" quality controls at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Okay. Then, I didn't have to call the manager to tell them it was sub-standard. They apparently already knew it since they had quality controls in place. And, since I was paying $435.00 a night for a room, I was pretty sure that my room was at the top of the list for quality control. And, as a note: I was there with a group. If I had not been there as part of a group event. I would have left. I love Disney. I go to Disney all the time. But, I have never stayed at one of the properties. I was excited for this trip.

It's a great place to visit but we wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI'm picky but couldn't fault AKL\u201d", "Author": "Bicardi65", "ReviewID": "UR83387323", "Content": "I could not believe some of the reviews I have read about AKL and I can be a picky customer.

When we first arrived we had been booked into a room with a Kingsize bed and bunk beds (not approrpriate for my children!! aged 15 & 22 yr old) we spoke with reception and within 20 mins we had been allocated another room and told we could be up-graded on the Monday if we were still not happy, but no need our room was lovely, two very comfortable king size beds and view overlooking the pool, we all instantly felt relaxed and happy. Our room was kept clean and tidy by staff with bed linen and towels frequently changed, the pleasant smelling complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body lotion came in a treat after a splash in the pool/water parks which are well maintained and guarded by vigilant life guards. Unlike some I thought the food was lovely and plentiful, we booked the Disney Dinning Plan and had some beautiful meals in the hotels, resorts and Downtown Disney, but I would recommend you pre-book because they can get very busy and that way you avoid standing about wasting precious Disney play time. AKL financially is a stretch on the wallet and you could get a hotel in Orlando of a much higher materialistic quality than AKL but you are also paying for the magic that is Disney and I for one would go back tomorrow if I could. The whole experience left me with many many happy memories I will cherish forever and in the many years I have travelled to Disney I would rate this experience as the BEST SO FAR.

Our favorite restaurant was Sanaa, which offers a great view of the wild animals from your dinner table, as well as fantastic food. It is a lot of fun to view the animals, and there are several viewing stations around the property. However, while I would strongly recommend a visit to the grounds, I would not recommend staying at this hotel. We had several problems with staff clerical errors. First, they checked us into a double bed room with a bunk bed (we had specifically reserved a king room) with a view of a concrete wall out the balcony. They also charged us more for this room than the single king we had reserved. We had to go back to the front desk to change rooms, and all hotel had available was a two-double bed room. At far cheaper hotels, the staff will often bring new room keys to you if there is a booking error - not so here. We also came during the slowest week of the year, so I would hate to see how the hotel runs during busy season. We purchased two 3 day park hopper tickets from the hotel, of which only one ticket worked when we tried to enter the parks the next day. It took the customer service more than 30 minutes to reissue my ticket, and they charged us again because the park computer systems do not interface with the park hotels, so the parks cannot refund or replace tickets issued at a Disney hotel. The customer service people were very nice about the incident, but it cost us the majority of the \"extra hour\" time that the park was only open to disney resort guests. When we tried to address the issue with the hotel management that evening, we were told that they can only discuss billing problems during normal business hours (ie time that should be spent at the parks). We returned during business hours and were told that a refund would be issued for the one ticket that was defective, and the refund would show up on our final bill. When we checked out, the hotel had accidentally charged us again for the defective ticket instead of refunding the ticket. The staff was very apologetic about the whole matter, but it was frustrating and time consuming. Trying to do anything at the front desk, whether it be checking in, buying the park tickets, or discussing a problem took a lot longer than it should have. Bottom line: buy your park tickets at the parks, not at a Disney hotel, and review your hotel bill very carefully. Also, be very patient anytime you need to approach the front desk. The room service was also a very long wait - we ordered one night after staying late at the parks (the hotel restaurants had closed) and were told that our food would be delivered in 30 minutes. Over an hour later, we called the front desk (because no one would pick up the room service line) and was told by the front desk that we need to talk to room service ourselves to verify that food is actually coming, and if room service doesn't answer, there is nothing the front desk can do. The food did eventually come, but we were about ready to leave the hotel to see if we could find a restaurant elsewhere. The rooms themselves were moderately comfortable, but I would put them slightly below a Best Western. The beds are very hard, and the frames squeak loudly anytime you jostle the mattress at all, so turning over in bed is sure to wake a light sleeper in the room with you. Otherwise, the rooms are average for a 2 star hotel. If you are going to stay at a Disney hotel, you might consider staying at a hotel connected to the monorail, because the busing from hotels to parks is not a fun experience. With the exception of the neighboring Animal Kingdom park, all of the bus rides were fairly long, with a long wait for the bus to come, and the buses were very crowded. The hotel did have nice restaurants, as well as a nice gym and spa. We did not use the pool, but the pool looked nice as well. The parks, as always, were great. I was told that if you stay in the most expensive rooms, the animals will occasionally come up to your balcony in the morning. So if you want to spend the money for the best room, you might like this hotel.

Our room was ready even though we were early. We were in room 3014 on the Giraffe trail. It was a great location for us. It was pool view, a short walk to the lobby (no stairs or elevators needed) and a short walk to the stairs/elevator to get out to the buses. The room was a nice size. There are double sinks, a closet with hangers, a huge dresser (three very deep large drawers), a balcony with two chairs, and we had two queen beds. Our room was very clean. Mousekeeping did a great job, although we did not get any towel art even with mousekeeping tips. We went to Mara multiple times a day to fill up our water bottle. We had one meal there (cheese flatbread- yum!). We did not eat at Jiko or Boma so I can't comment on the food. The pool was great. There were always plenty of towels and chairs. My stepdaughter enjoyed the slide. The playground was lots of fun when my nieces came to visit from Pop Century. The animals were amazing! we went out to look for them in the mornings, the afternoons before dinner, and then with night vision at night when we returned. It was so wonderful to be able to see them roaming around, often times very close up. My only complaint about the resort was the bus service. We often had to wait for 40+ minutes for a bus. Sometimes they would come but would be full from Kidani. However, I spoke with another group who stayed the same week we did and said they had no problem with the buses (???).

The \"Chilled Shrimp\" on the R/S menu were on looks alone, enough to give a solid bout of upset stomach, but upon eating did not disappoint, they really did deliver on the appearance.

The Disney Transport which is amazingly efficient (luckily) picks up and drops off at all the parks, but Animal Kingdom is a 20 minute jammed pack bus ride to the other parks, so unless Animal Kingdom Park is your main focus, I would recommend one of the hotels nearer Magic Kingdom or Downtown etc. Typical Disney \"welcome home\" staff that deliver on the service.

My niece is a huge animal lover so there was never really any other choice when it came to deciding on a hotel to stay in. We booked a meal plan, which I would highly recommend, and we also booked a dinner at Cinderella's Royal Table for my nieces birthday, which I wouldn't - but I'll discuss that a little later. The rooms are of an average size but more than adequate for sleeping / changing and storing your luggage. The balcony with a view of the animals was a great way to entertain a 6 year old while taking it in turns to get ready. Just like Africa? Absolutely not. But just like a 6 year olds Disneyfied perception of what Africa is like? Absolutely. And that's the great thing about the Disney hotels: everything is geared towards satisfying their expectations and everything is tailored to making their time there a special one. What might make me cringe, a six year old will think is absolutely magical. The pool was big enough to never feel too crowded and it was never any trouble getting a lounger. The food at breakfast in Boma was fantastic, although it got a little much for us after a week and I tended to grab a croissant from the Mara cafe (a bit like a fast food place by the pool). We tried Boma a couple of times for dinner, as reservations were never needed. The food there was OK, and with lots of choice, but we tended to prefer the a la carte options. Jiko - the signature restaurant in the hotel - was also very good, and we didn't require a reservation there either. They also serve Tusker lager throughout the hotel which was a nice touch. One of the benefits of staying in the Disney hotel - as well as getting the buses directly into the parks - is the room key system of paying for anything anywhere within the resort. This includes all the shops in downtown Disney aswell (inc the sunglasses shop). However everything around Disney is geared towards parting you from your money, and they are experts at it! There wasn't a day went by that my niece \"needed\" one thing or another, even if it was nearly identical to the thing she'd \"needed\" and bought the previous day. One tip is to try and book as many restaurants as you can as soon as you arrive (or even before you go) as these book up fast. We were given a booklet detailing all the hotels and restaurants when we checked in, and on the third day I rang up the Disney reservation helpline (free from your room) and managed to make dinner reservations at various restaurants for the rest of our time there. The woman on the other end of the phone was extremely helpful in helping us decide on the restaurants based on the cuisine we wanted. Our favourite restaurants were the Japanese Teppan Edo in Epcot and Citrico's at the Grand Floridian Resort, although we enjoyed every meal we had on the dining plan. Except one.... and that was supposed to be the most special meal. As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, we booked a meal at Cinderellas Royal Table at the castle in the Magic Kingdom on the evening of my nieces birthday. She was so excited, and dressed up in her own princess outfit in order to meet Cinderella. The experience up until the meal was magical for my niece - the castle looks and feels real, and she got to meet and chat with Cinderella before posing for a photograph with her. But once you are taken up the stairs to the restaurant, the magic really ends. It's busy, noisy and looks like a regular restaurant. And the food was fairly awful. They do have a kind of song near the end of the meal where Cinderellas mice come out, but by the point the magic had already been lost. Much better, and much cheaper, was the character breakfast we booked at the Animal Kingdom Park. Here you have a regular buffet breakfast but all the Disney characters come round the tables while you're eating and sign the autograph books and take pictures. It was far more informal, and far more enjoyable for my niece. Just seeing the excitement in her face and seeing how real it was for her still makes me smile; this wasn't somebody dressed up in a Donald-duck / Goofy costume, this WAS Donald duck and Goofy. We also got tickets to the Cirque du Soleil, which my niece (mostly!) sat through and was entertained by (we also booked this through the helpline from the room). The only times we ventured outside of Disney was to Florida Mall and to the Universal Studios, and we got a taxi each time. These weren't too cheap, so I'd probably think about hiring a car for a couple of days if I wanted to explore more. Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It's not super luxurious, but the atmosphere is relaxed and there's a really good vibe about the place. And the main thing was that my niece loved it. The only thing I'd change is the fact that they only had one room with internet, which was a little frustrating given the size of the hotel. The service wasn't fantastic either, but I think that has more to do with the corporation than the hotel itself. You are better arranging anything you need through the central Disney helpline, which is free to call from inside your room.

I loved my room, from the African wallpaper, tiles and shower curtain in the bathroom, through to the African shield on the door. It was all so different and a change from the usual decor of most hotels. I did not find the beds the most comfortable ever though, they did creak a lot and were quite high off the ground, that I worried my daughter would really hurt herself should she fall out of bed. I had a standard room, near the lobby which was great. We did consider upgrading and paying more for a savannah room, but knowing what I know now, I am glad i didnt pay the extra. I think you have ideas that the savannahs are full of animals, but there are not as many as you think, and in my opinion does not warrant the huge supplement . Disney Dining Plan was great, cannot fault the food. Boma although amazing was a bit loud/mad/busy most of the time. Disney bus service excellent and I thought the distance to the parks was fine and not too far away, although the bus to Downtown Disney is about the furthest/longest as stops at Typhoon Lagoon first. If i had to complain about one thing, it would be the pool. It is extremely busy, day and night. Wouldnt recommend paying for a pool view if you like to sit on your balcony for peace and quiet. Would of loved a quiet pool and think just the one pool is a mistake. We went late on about 9.30 pm one night, and it was still crazy, too busy to be enjoyable.

The rooms are definitely deluxe by Disney standards, meaning you are really paying for the atmosphere outside your room. The animals, the various savannahs, the gorgeous (and clean) pool and the easy access to the park.

The rooms on the fifth floor are part of the Disney Vacation Club (although we are not DVC members and booked this accommodation as you would a regular room via the website) and were a really nice alternative to the standard room given the full kitchen in the one bedroom suite (kitchenette in the studio) and laundry machine. Because we were not DVC members, we had daily housekeeping service which was excellent. As you would expect with Disney World properties, the service and hospitality was excellent throughout. The food in the restaurants was good. I heard more complaints about the Disney Dining Plan than I heard kudos, but am told it's a wonderful way to save some money. The bell desk is 100% full service. They received and held a motorized scooter for a member of our traveling party. They also received, held and refrigerated groceries for us which we had ordered online (http://gardengrocer.com/) and had delivered to the hotel . Just a couple notes, if you are staying in the DVC rooms (whether DVC or not), detergent for laundry is provided (but not dryer sheets). Dishwashing liquid and automatic dishwasher detergent is also provided as are towels and sponges. I didn't know this and had ordered some from the grocer. This was our third stay at this hotel and we would not hesitate to stay here again. Transportation to all parks is via bus with Animal Kingdom being the closest. The staff throughout Disney is so helpful and friendly. And the families traveling there are also quick to help a stranger, too. The animals visible from the savannah view rooms are always neat, too. Even if you don't have a savannah view, there are many points throughout the hotel to see animals for everyone... including while walking from your room to the lobby sometimes... depending on which wing you are in. I would probably suggest going to one of the full service spas around Disney, if you are looking for a relaxing afternoon as the one in the AKL is four treatment rooms right off the workout area and is more akin to what you might find at your local gym.

Not so much. We arrived with online check in and were greeted as we got out of the car with our Disney \"package\". While I am all for hurrying things along, this didn't make me feel welcomed just rushed. I couldn't ask a front desk person questions about the room or about the celebrations I had planned. Didn't like it. Plus our package of material had a map of the hotel and a sheet of what was happening at the hotel. At other properties, even with online check in, you get the brochures from the parks, and all sorts of other paperwork. But the real disappointment was when we went to our room. We stayed here six years ago - and thought it was nice. Either my mind has shaded it rosy - or I just liked the animals. Although we had a Disney passholder discounted rate, the fact that they gave us (or anyone) that room is quite sad. Room 4009 has a bunk bed and a queen in the size of a cracker box. The balcony overlooked the parking lot but there would be no way for an adult to get on it. As you opened the door, it was not a sliding door but one that pushed forward, it actually touched the railing. The balcony had to be less than 24\" wide. It barely fit a chair so it wasn't very long either! I called down to see if our room could be changed. Was told someone would call me back. 25 minutes later, I called again (I would have gone down but I was afraid my luggage would get delivered and I'd miss it). I got someone who said they had another room available on the 4th floor with a limited view. I said that would be fine. We went down to 4259 and the room was larger. I know they advertise the rooms at 380sf or so but that first one was much smaller. Plus, our new room had a balcony that went across the length of the room like most balconies do. We had a view of animals (giraffe, zebras, elands, ostriches, African cattle, vultures, etc) the entire time so I do not think the view was limited at all. It was great. But the room itself is very small for a deluxe. We had bunk beds and a queen. Every time you moved on the queen it made noise. LOUD noises. The springs were horrid. I woke up all night just rolling over! The bath supplies were face and bath soap, shampoo and conditioner. At the Polynesian, they throw in shower gel and lotion and a lot of other goodies. There is no way to compare the two hotels. Animal Kingdom is a deluxe moderate - but not a deluxe. It has one shop. Just like Port Orleans or any other moderate. But it is deluxe in the size and look of the lobby - plus two sit down restaurants. The slide/pool were about the same as Port Orleans Riverside. The animals are the draw here. But by the 5th day, you don't even go to the window to look out. There is a flat screen television, coffee maker, and small fridge. The rooms are clean and we had Disney towel animals daily. I can't see myself staying here again. Absolutely LOVE Boma's for breakfast. Haven't done dinner there in years. But I love the breakfast. Mara's is the food court type of restaurant - nothing special. Ice cream offerings are only prepackaged bars/sandwiches. I was really looking forward to the night vision goggles everyone talks about thinking we could go exploring. Nope! There is a lookout room - where people get in line to wait for the two pair of goggles. There is an attendant to hand you the goggles. The line flows as the family involvement is. Meaning, for our family - we took about five minutes or less for all of us to get a look. Meanwhile, a man and his 7 year old son were there when we got there and still there when we left asking all sorts of questions about the animals they were viewing. We waited about 20 minutes for our view at 9:00. Keep in mind, these are the same giraffe/zebras/elands you see all day. The only difference is they are green. If you rate just the rooms, this hotel is a moderate but throw in the animals - and there's where it gets the deluxe rating. We were there for my husband's 50th birthday - which I think should be a huge event and my daughter's birthday as well. They did give the room one birthday card (we gave to her) and a birthday cake towel. They did nothing special - and when you take into account our first room, they really could not care less about celebrations and trying to make your stay a little more magical. It would not have hurt them at all to give us the 4259 room right off the bat. But they gave us 4009 first - which just really does not make sense. Unless the hotel is packed solid - NO ONE should have to have that room! In our room, we could hear the neighbors when they flushed the toilet - and when they used the sliding glass door.

We had a pool view room which was nice and my parents had booked a Savannah View room so we just went into their room to see the animals. My youngest loved it! We had to tear her away from their balcony. She did drop a shoe over one day, and we were able to get it back within a few hours. Although my parents did mention that they probably wouldn't do the Savannah view again since they only got to see a giraffe twice from the room. Mainly it was zebra, cattle, antelope...but still fun for the little ones. Yes, the hotel is quite far from most parks (except Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios). We had pretty good luck with the bus system in the beginning of the trip, then near the end we had to really wait a long time for a few. I do wish that the hotel would have the bus waiting area set up like at the parks where you have to stand in a line to get on the bus. We had this issue on our last day where we walked up to the bus stop for Blizzard Beach/Hollywood Studios right as that bus drove away, so we had to wait for 20 mins and when the bus finally arrived, everyone who had only been waiting for 5 mins or so rushed the bus and were all able to get on and get seats. I was able to get one (thankfully since I am 6 months prego and had a 1.5 year old to carry) but the rest of my family had to stand. I think that next time we visit, we'll try to stay somewhere near Epcot since it seems to be more centrally located. We were on the Quick Service dining plan, which was absolutely great! We each got 2 meals and 2 snacks per day and ended up using the last 2 meals for breakfast on our last morning and ended up with 6 leftover snacks, which was fine. We didn't try Boma or Jiko since we didn't want to spend the money, but the food at the Mara was very good. My only gripe is that I wished that they had another menu that they would swap out every 2 or 3 days, because after a few days of eating the same exact thing every morning for breakfast or dinner gets old fast. It was nice to be able to use them in all the parks though. We found out that we could get creative though since each came with an entree, drink and dessert I would swap out the dessert for another drink. I needed water more than a brownie most of the time anyway. Or if we were at a place that had snacks they would let us swap in a snack instead of their dessert options. It takes a few days to get the hang of the meals plans, but luckily every person we dealt with at the registers was great at making sure we got the most bang for our buck. We did both water parks, first Typhoon Lagoon on Wednesday then Blizzard Beach on Saturday. We weren't super early risers since we would be out at the parks late at night, and got the Typhoon around 11:30am and it was PACKED. To the point where it took us about 30 mins to find an chair....then trying to find a spot in the shade to put it was another task in itself. I found that you really need a spot to call your own, especially with a little one. So while we were at that park eating lunch I called the WDW phone number and got connected to the Recreation dept and I booked a private cabana for Blizzard Beach. It's not cheap ($250, plus tax), but for an entire day you get a private area with 6 chairs, an umbrella, a few little tables, a locker and a cooler with waters. You also have a person who comes to check on you every 20-30 mins and will bring you your towels and will also order your lunch and deliver it to you. Worth every penny in my book. They only have 8 cabanas though so I would highly recommend booking ahead of time. Most every cast member that we dealt with was very helpful and friendly. Although the lady that painted my daughters face in Toon Town was the rudest person ever. She barely said two words to us and never once cracked a smile. I have a hard time biting my tongue, so I kept repeating \"Pixie dust, pixie dust\" in my head so I wouldn't rip her head off. The hotel staff was amazing. My parents lost a pair of reading glasses and they credited them $200 for them. Our room was clean when we arrived and remained that way during our entire stay. The fridge is great since you can really stock up on snacks and drinks from the Mara and keep them in there, also great for us with a baby to have a place to store milk and juice. The room is not huge, especially if you need to set up the portable crib...that really made it hard to move around the room, but it's Disney so how much time do you really need to spend in the room! The beds were very comfortable, but very noisy! Everytime I would roll over or switch positions, I was afraid I would wake up the baby.... Oh and if you want to see Fantasmic, get there super early! We got there an hour ahead of time and it was already full. I also highly recommend the Wishes Dessert Party: http://www.disunplugged.com/2009/06/24/disney-debuts-magic-kingdom-wishes-dessert-party/ We made reservations a few months prior and had a great seat for tht fireworks.

We booked our vacation directly through Disney. We chose AKL, premium dining plan, and concierge level. We were beyond happy with our choices! From the minute we drove up to the hotel the staff was friendly, accomodating, and full of information. With the concierge level you get met at the doors and personally taken to your room where you will be checked in. Our room had bunkbeds and a queen bed, this arrangement was perfect for us and felt roomier. Another bonus was our amazing view of the savannah and animals. The concierge level is also worth it for the lounge. AKL provides food throughout the day, drinks, and has staff on hand for any needs. A lot of people say isn't it too much food and drinks when you have concierge and the dining plan but we used our dining plan credits to eat at all of the nicer restaurants (usually 2 credits) and so the lounge was perfect when we didn't have a meal booked. All of the staff at AKL was terrific but especially the concierge staff. We decided at the last minute to add an extra night onto our vacation. Naturally we couldn't stay in our concierge room (School vacation weeks = sold out) but the staff moved us to another room and checked us out and back in right there in the concierge lounge. Tips: When you book concierge level and dining plans they will be good for the entire day when you check out of the hotel! When we moved rooms we were no longer concierge level and our cards reflected that. However our old cards were still good until that evening. It sounded crazy to us but if any of the theme parks are open till 2 A.M. (like when we were there) sleep in late and stay at the parks until they close. We were able to go on every ride we wanted to with no lines! If you are driving to Disney or renting a car pay to have valet service. We made a lot of dining reservations at other properties. We looked into the Disney transit service but decided to just take our own car.

After several weeks of frustration with the Disney website getting our hotel and meal plan accomodations, the day finally arrived. We had reserved a king bed (we thought) but when we checked in, we were told they had only two queen beds. We were puzzled. \"We are on our honeymoon and we booked a king bed.\" No help. She told us that all kings were booked, but if we would take a queen bed for a few nights, they would find us a king bed as soon as possible. Disgusted without how the first evening started, we went up to our room. We found both of our rooms clean and tidy. The rooms were nothing more or less generous than any other hotel. We had some difficulty getting soap, though each day they cleaned our room and left us every other toiletry item. The hotel is the furthest from any park, and taking a bus to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot was a time consuming adventure. The Disney busses did not appear to show up to the hotel on a regular basis, but when they did arrive, we usually had an opportunity to get on any bus we wanted without having to wait for the next. About seven days into our ten day adventure, we decided we wanted to go to Daytona Beach and so we decided we would need a car. We called the front desk for information regarding a rental car, and they were no help at all. They refused to assist. Disney does NOT want you going off property for ANY reason, so they are certainly not going to help you get a car to leave. We finally called a local company and found that Disney actually has a rental car company ON THEIR PROPERTY. After renting a car, we discovered that we should have done that from the beginning. If you have a key to your hotel, you can park for free at any park, and it's a lot easier to get around to the parks in a rental car - especially if you have dinner reservations and don't want to spend an hour and a half park hopping to get to the right resort and restaurant. The front desk and concierge service was abyssmal. It seemed that any request we had from trying to find a massage to finding out the schedule of fire works at a park were all met with \"I don't know.\" One night we tried to rent a DVD player to watch a DVD we had brought. The front desk informed us that there were no DVD players for rent to the hotel guests. So we went out and bought a DVD player at Wal-Mart. When we brought it back to hook up to the television in the room, we found that the back of the entertainment center was bolted closed and there was no way to hook up the player to the tv. UGH! I won't make this a review of the parks, but the restaurants in the hotel were not spectacular. We did not get to eat in the large buffet style cafeteria but I heard that the food was pretty good there. We did eat in the fancier restaurant on the first floor but it was farm from the best food of the trip. We did see plenty of animals from both of our rooms. Mostly giraffes. The pool and hot tubs were a welcomed respite, and not too crowded. Despite the number of rooms in the hotel (and quite a walk to most of them from the lobby) we did not feel over crowded. The laundry facilities were easily accessible and relatively convenient if not a bit expensive. The rooms were quiet, but they certainly are not designed to keep you indoors. Disney wants you out of the room and spending your money in their parks and in their gift shops. That's also the reason behind them keeping DVD players and hookups out of the room. In the end, the hotel experience was more than adequate, but it was far from the honeymoon romance we desired. But again, if we wanted more relaxation and romance, we would have gone elsewhere. For what it was, we had a pleasant stay, but the luster you expect from a Disney property was certainly not present.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antrim, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat holiday\u201d", "Author": "cynfranelle", "ReviewID": "UR74183798", "Content": "husband daughter and i stayed here for 2 special dates our daughters 4th birthday and our 21st anniversary and it was fab from the minute we got there to we left was all we expected and more. we arrived and were given room overlooking carpark but i said i would not be happy with it so lovely girl in reception changed us right away to a suvanagh room with great views how happy were we.

We saw animals (giraffes, storks, cranes, ankole cattle, water buffalo, eland etc etc) from our balcony every day. The decor was very in keeping with what you would imagine African decor to look like. It appeared well kept and saw no visible wear and tear. There are lifts located all around the hotel. There is also a coin operated laundry area for guests to use. We spent $1 on detergent and $2 on washing and another $2 on drying and all was washed and dry within 50 mins. There are 3 places where you can eat. The Mara which is a canteen type eaterie that serves all day (06.30-00.00) although lunch/dinner can get boring unless you like burgers/pizzas and chicken nuggets. Price wise average breakfast we spent $15 for 2. There is a buffet style restaurant called Boma which serves breakfast and dinner and i would highly recommend this especially the desserts namely the zebra dommes (ladies that is definately one to try). Price wise the breakfast buffet was $23.99 and dinner was $34.99 plus taxes and tips. There is a 3rd restaurant called Jiko, but we did not try this as the food on the menu did not appeal. Looking at the menu average cost for a main meal was about $30 plus tax. The lobby in the hotel is very appealing to the eye and there are plenty of places to sit and relax with also a tv playing disney films for the children.

I was pleasantly surprised - the room wasn't as small as I had been led to believe; it was fine for the three of us with two queen beds. Bathroom was a bit disappointing, shower with curtain over the bath, very small area. A couple of corridors along from the lobby, once we had tried a couple of routes we found the best way. View of savannah was good from our room, we had giraffes and zebras very close to our window (on 2nd floor, room 2252) most of the time, apart from about four days when there was nothing at all. If you are struggling to pay for the savannah room I would suggest you don't bother. There are numerous viewing places all over the hotel and for the two minutes a day (max) you are looking out of the window is it worth it?? Also there are night viewing areas with night-vision goggles around the grounds. We had planned to sit on the balcony at night watching the animals with a bottle of wine while our daughter slept, but it was very humid and so couldn't stand to. As for being out of the way, this didn't affect us at all. We drove to the parks instead of getting the bus as I couldn't be bothered to wait and wanted to be in control of when we left, heading off to restaurants etc after the parks. Jiko is good but expensive.. Boma gets old very quickly, and if you are on the dining plan a meal there counts as table service, although is technically a buffet. Mara is the fast food canteen but is fine for dining plan grub. If you're paying for your meals, go to cracker barrell for breakfast, was definately much better value and quality. There is a shortcut off to the 192 (Sherbeth Rd) right near AKL which saves time. We were lucky to get the dining plan thrown in as part of our deal but I don't know if I would have paid for it. Even for free, you have to consider the 20% tip per meal. So for a Jiko (two point per person) meal for two with a glass of wine you are looking at about $20-$25 dollars for a tip. If you are on the dining plan, paid for or not, read up about the dining plan before you go and of course plan your reservations. The pool area is good but very busy and people reserve chairs very early, sometimes not using them all day which is annoying. Free pool towels which is handy. The fitness centre was a bit outdated but practically empty the (few) times I visited. We used Simba's Cub house twice for evening child care - my girl was the only kid there the first night but three the second.

I have to be honest, i was a little nervous about the Magical Express baggage pick up and bus situation. But no need to worry disney pulled it off with no problems! We just checked our bags in Virginia and through \u201cThe Disney magic\u201d they were in our rooms by the time we returned from the park on our first night. The bus from the airport went off flawlessly. We waited for about 20 mins on the bus for it to leave. It took us about 45 mins from the time we left the airport until the time we got to our hotel. This seems like a long time, but they have a movie that you can watch on the bus (a plus for the kids) and the bus does make stops at other resorts. When we got the the AKL, our room was not ready for check in. We did the online check in, so we bypassed the long check-in/out line and headed right to the counter. The front desk staff was so helpful and happy to answer all the questions that we had. We checked in and headed down to the Mara for a quick bit to eat for lunch. By the time we were done with lunch our room was ready for us and we went right up! The room was beautiful! We had the Savanna view room, with bunk beds. The room was a decent size. It has a mini fridge, flat screen TV, Safe, Small table ect. The BEST part about this room was the Savanna view/balcony. My wife and I spent every night and early morning sitting out on the balcony while our child slept. A few nights we could even hear and see the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom! Also, at night the giraffe would lay down in front of our room! I would recommend the 3rd floor and up, if you have a choice. We also spent sometime every day at the pool. It was great and refreshing on those hot florida summer days! It is a large pool with a small kids type slide. I think the max depth was under 5 foot. It ha large lights that keep it well light at night. There is a small bar, and plenty of seating. They also have life jackets for kids. There is a small kids pool and a small hot tub also. There are 3 restaurants at the hotel. We ate at Boma, and the Mara while we were there. I would HIGHLY recommend a Disney Dining plan, and the meals can be expensive. We had the Deluxe plan for everyone in our family. This includes 3 meals and 2 snacks per day for everyone. We ended up having 5 meals left over and used all of our snacks. We did ask on the last day if we could exchange out some of our meals for snacks, which they gladly did at a rate of 3 snacks per meal. So we had plenty of snacks for the plane ride back! We also received 3 refillable resort drink mugs! These were great because you could fill them with any of the soda, tea, or coffee at the mara drink stand. We ate breakfast @ the Mara/Boma most of the mornings that we were at the resort. Dinner at Boma is excellent! I would recommend making a reservation though, as it is really busy. We did walk in 1 night, but had to wait 45 mins. I read a lot of complaints about the distance of the hotel to the parks and having to wait for the bus. We only had a problem with the busses one night. The first night we stayed at the magic kingdom until it closed (to watch the parade and fireworks) we had to wait about 40mins for the bus. This was ONLY because everyone was trying to leave the park at the same time. Other then that, we waited a max of 10-20 mins for a bus. It was very easy! Its about a 20min ride to the Magic Kingdom (the furthest park away). I can tell you this, after a long day at the park, i didn't mind the 20min in the A/C of the bus.

We choose not to tag our bags and picked them up before boarding the Magical Express. Check in was very smooth. We were even able to get my Mom who was also visiting Orlando added to our room so she could spend a couple of days with us at the parks. As others have mentioned, this lobby is spectacular. You keep finding interesting things about it each time you walk in. The room while not spacious (as we knew from TA reviews) was clean and comfortable. The view was AMAZING. The giraffes were out when we arrived and were usually out in the late afternoon. We also saw lots of birds, ostriches, zebras and antelope. I thought the lighting and comfort of beds, etc was fine. The hotel was very quiet at night and we were able to get a good rest after our long days. Bus transfer to the parks was fairly efficient and we usually did not have to wait terribly long. The distance from Magic Kingdom/Epcot I thought was the biggest draw back to this beautiful hotel. We found the bus trip to be rather long especially if you didn\u2019t get a seat. This was especially difficult with our stroller, bags and four year old daughter in tow. We ate one breakfast and two lunches at the Mara quick service restaurant and it was good. I regretted a bit not getting a refillable mug when we first got there as it would have been handy for morning coffees and drinks by the pool. The dining plan portions are huge with a massive dessert accompanying each one. We found the two huge meals a day to be even more food than we needed. We also dined at Boma one evening. Boma was a treat with its fabulous African themed buffet. The pool area was huge and beautiful. It easily rivals the pools we encountered at Beaches resorts. Much busier though. This pool is full of people from morning to night, much like all of Disney. Getting a lounge chair proved to be difficult sometimes with so many people at the pool and likely many not even at the pool but reserving their chair. Services available that we used on site were the gift shop for milk /beer and souvenirs, the concierge for reservations and questions, the photopass desk and laundry facilities. In the heat we were going through clothes like crazy and needed to do wash about 5 days into our trip. Other nice features of the hotel are the playground, the viewing area, and the activities throughout the day. This hotel could be a destination in itself and we would have liked to have more time to spend at the property. I would highly recommend AKL to get away from it all after the long hot days in the park. It would have been a bit disappointing though if we had got a poolside room. You would lose the peacefulness and feeling of getting away from it all. It was a great place to see and stay at once. Should our travels ever take us back to Disney, we\u2019d likely try to get a deluxe resort closer to the park on the monorail. You spend enough time waiting in Disney and we found the travel time took up too much precious time on an already jam packed schedule.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort/Magical Time/Amazing Birthday\u201d", "Author": "_lovetotravel4_33514", "ReviewID": "UR72255592", "Content": "Stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge- Jambo House Villas last June. I am planning another trip and was reading some of these recent reviews and I felt compelled to share my experience .This resort is exotic and beautiful the moment you walk in. The staff greeted us quickly. Check in was very fast and friendly even though they were busy. Our room was a little jaunt from the lobby where you walk out and catch the buses and the pool and both restaurants but this gave us more opportunity to catch another view of different animals as your walking through the halls and good exercise. If the boys were getting antsy while my husband and I were gathering last minute things or still getting ready, they would go to several different animal look out spots and try to name the different ones and spot any new animals. They would also go to the lobby where they played great African music and there are several comfortable spots to sit and watch childrens movies or disney cartoons while waiting. There is alot of art and interesting artifacts to see as well. I traveled with my two sons 6 and 16 and husband. Arrived on a Wednesday stayed till the following Tuesday. First night ate at Boma it was very good, large variety of food. We planned this trip to celebrate my 6 year old sons birthday and everything was absolutely amazing for him and well everyone. While the boys swam and rode the slide, my husband and I sat and watched them and sipped on a few cocktails. It was nice they had complimentary life jackets for little ones. The slide does drop off into about 31/2 4 feet of water. Wearing the jacket made my 6yr old feel much better. The pool is not as large as other resorts it is very clean and relaxing with plenty of towels and lounge chairs and the landscaping was lovely. They also have a spa which is situated over by this beautiful bird area. You can watch many different types. Again, the staff was very helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was great, again very pleasant and prompt. We took one day for some down time slept in and did a bit of laundry which was convenient to have in the hotel but we did have to walk a little bit to reach it, not a big deal though. Our room was great, clean, roomy we had a king size bed and a sofa sleeper, the bed was very comfortable and the dark blinds were very nice if you sleep in once in awhile. Sink, mini fridge, coffee maker, table chairs flat screen tv lots of toiletries, the balcony was so cool to sit out there in the morning and evenings and just gaze out at the Serengeti. Ok well almost. I feel bad for the other guests who had some issues at AKL. If they read anything about the resort they were staying at they should of know the AKL is the furthest hotel from all the parks which of course would take a bit longer. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a bus only because we happened to miss the one pulling away. Your on vacation and have spent alot of money to have this experience, shouldnt you slow down a bit and relax. Instead of constantly rushing? The gift shop was great they had many snacks and grocery items you could take to your room and stick in the mini frig(cereal,milk, yogurt) and many great gifts. One minor glich we did not realize, one day we were at one park and felt like we were done there so we headed to Epcot to use another days ticket to enter there and they would not let us. We knew we had one extra park day to use since we had that lounging day and then went to Downtown Disney instead and did not use our park ticket that day. Unless you buy the Park Hopper add on you can only enter one park a day. Oh well we just went back to the first park and had more fun there and did more shopping. We did pay extra for the savannah view with our room and we loved loved it. Every morning to wake up to giraffes and zebras and amazing birds it was just incredibe and beautiful. I just can't say enough. When I told the boys we were taking this trip, this was the first place they wanted to stay. So worth it. While we were at the Magic Kingdom on Thursday the actual day of my 6year olds birthday we purchased a gift ahead of time, in which they came to our room while we were at the parked and had several different decorated boxes with different gifts inside from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Pluto and Tink. They sprinkled pixie dust in the room, tink was waiting for him Mickey left several gifts including his autograph and so many other gifts-cant mention them all. My son was amazed at how they knew it was his birthday and where he was staying. To walk in and have the entire room sprinkled with different size boxes and gifts was just so so Magical, if you could only see his face. Everyone at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and every park we went to made my son feel incredibly special. They wished him Happy Birthday and stop and talk to him and he was able to steer the Jungle Safari boat at the Magic Kingdom Park and wore the captain hat. Ok Ok enough there were so many magical wonderful things that happened I could go on and on. So to finish up the Tuesday day of check out we left all our luggage with the concierge staff and let them know we would be back for the Magical Express bus later to take us to the airport but we were heading to Epcot one last time and they took care of all our belongings. We still had meals on our Dining Plan that was not used. We did purchase the plan which gives you one table service meal one quick service meal and one snack per person each day. Alot Alot of food it was great What we did is we went to Epcot ordered our lunch and then asked a few people behind us if we could buy them lunch, to use up our plan so as not to waste it. They were shocked. What an incredible trip. My soon to be 18 year old wants to spend his birthday here in September.

Cast members were all over the place, all eager to answer questions and/or offer assistance. We had a one bedroom villa, savanna view. Giraffes, zebras, ostriches, and other animals were right outside our room! The room was very comfortable with a sleeper sofa and sleeper armchair (about the width of a daybed and very comfy), plus a king bed in the separate bedroom. Two full baths and a full kitchen, plus washer and dryer. It was very spacious but still very cozy.Our room was a short walk from the lobby, and just a couple of doors down from the laundry room, arcade, and community room; yet it was very quiet. Only twice was I able to hear people chatting while walking in the hall. Noise is not a problem here... Sanaa (restaurant) is just lovely: Indian food with some African influences (try the orange-sesame cake for dessert; amazing!). We all loved our dinners. I worried about the distance and waiting/transit times to the parks (I read many comments online and in guidebooks from people griping about this issue). But we went in \"high season\" and never waited longer than 10 minutes for a bus to or from any park (and we left the parks at closing time every night we were there). Also, the buses are shared by Jambo house and Kidani village; I didn't feel that the shared route made the commute to/from the parks any longer. I will definitely return. Only one issue: no food court. We used a meal plan and realized we had a lot of counter service credits left the night before we departed. I think if we had been nearer to a food court, we would have used them all up. (The nearest food court is at Jambo house, a decent walk.) There was a little golf cart that shuttled guests to and from Jambo house, but only in the daytime. Still, with better meal planning on my part, I will be back to Kidani village.

We saw animals from our patio at all times of the day (pelicans, zebras,ankole cattle, girafffe and more). The rooms themselves are small for a family of 4 and their luggage. As well as the great savanna view from our room, we could see the top of Everest over the trees. As for \"club level rooms\", the club lounge is on the 6th floor. We were on the 4th and it was quite a walk to the lounge. The lounge has ample supply of beverages and different snacks throughout the day, we went most mornings for the breakfast items. I was disappointed the lounge closed around 10pm. We usually arrived back at the resort from the parks after that time and would have liked to have stopped in for beverages. The biggest disappointment for us at the AKL was the bus transportation to all the parks. Our wait times were anywhere from 15-35 minutes to get a bus leaving the resort and coming back from the parks it was usually a 30-60 minute wait. I do not remember wait times being so long on previous visits at other resorts. As a deluxe resort I would expect less wait times. We were there 10 days, so we could afford to wait because we had plenty of days at the parks, however, we needed to plan on at least an hour transportation time to be on time for dinner reservations at EPCOT.

We stayed in a savannah view room - we saw giraffe and other animals outside of our room daily - definitely a unique experience. There are plenty of areas around the hotel for viewing the animals, and if you don't want to spring the extra $100+/night for the view, you can get by seeing the animals throughout the hallway windows and the many viewing areas in the hotel. We ate at BOMA one night (just okay) and the Mara for breakfast and lunch (good food, a bit chaotic with kids at times). We didn't eat at Jiko, but peeked in and it was mainly empty for the nights we were there. The pool at AKL was smaller than expected, and crowded! We visited the pool at the villas - a long walk away but worth the smaller crowd. My main complaint about this hotel is that it is FAR FAR FAR from everywhere else in Disney, except for Animal Kingdom. The bus ride alone to Magic Kingdom is a full 20 minutes, and when you add in wait times for the shuttle (which always seemed to be longer for AKL than the other hotels), it takes at times a full hour to get to anywhere else on the Disney grid.

Buffet breakfast at Boma was lovely, so much choice with some of it African themed, ate there once for dinner which was also lovely but then discovered the signature restaurants!!

The imposing building and large front driveway leading up to the building is the first to greet you. There is no shortage of staff to greet you or ask if you need help. Once inside there is a large foyer with African details throughout. Lots of lounge chairs and even a TV playing old Disney cartoons to entertain. The concierge could book your activities or get you tickets. We also got tickets to a Luah at the Polynesian Village Hotel. At the back of the lobby was a large window which must have been the entire 5 stories tall. Lots of African artifacts to look at all over. Even a Caricature artist was stationed there each evening. Our hotel room overlooked the Arushna Savanna and almost every night, a giraffe was sleeping right infront of our balcony. Each day we would see giraffe, zebra and various African animals and birds. The staff at this hotel and all of the theme parks can't do enough to make your stay memorable. The room was a large double (wouldn't say it was a queen) with bunk beds and not overly large. The bathroom was dimly lit and the door almost swung into the toilet so it was very small. At least there were 2 sinks on the other side of it. That helped. The pool was large and open 24 hrs. There was a small children's slide. It was lifeguarded from 10-10 each day with a Tikki bar. The restaurants were nice looking but we didn't eat at them. We had booked other restaurants at each of the theme parks we went to each day. The quick service cafeteria had food. We only ate there for 1 breakfast and a late night snack. It was a little pricey but no different than the theme park prices. They even sold microwave foods since there was a microwave in this cafe as the hotel room itself only had a fridge in it. We saw people making their own toast for breakfast there and if you bought a refillable mug, you could add any pop or coffee at any time in any of the hotels. That would be a challenge as they are pretty strict on security and we were screened each time we entered and exited the hotel. If you stayed at this hotel you could visit the Villas next door and use their facilities. The pool was smaller but had a different slide. From there you could see more animals too. There were staff stationed outside each outer area to ask questions. A nice \"cast member\" from Nairobi I believe chatted with us about the giraffes. At night you could observe them through night vision goggles too. There were children's activities each day. You could also pay to have babysitting service. My 9 and 11 year old only took advantage of crayon etchings of African animals on the floor of the lobby. They were also going to make cookies after that but we declined the offer as we were off to a theme park. The hotel offered the free Disney shuttle buses but we had a rental so never used the service as you were given free parking to each theme park with your stay. We also saw cruise line buses picking up people and also airport shuttle buses. Although the room was pricey it was worth having a Savannah view even if we did it just once. There were observation decks for guests to see the animals, but with it being so hot and humid and there were mosquitos at night, it was nice to slip back into the room quick after you took photos of the animals. We did luck out as not all of the Savannah rooms would get animals parked out infront of their balcony. We just happened to be given a lobby level room that was infront of a feeding station. The grounds staff were always out each day cutting the grass and tending to the animals' needs. They seemed to be well cared for. Our maid (\"mousekeeper\") made different animals out of the towels for the first couple days after we left a tip each day for her. Not sure if all the housekeepers do that. She was very thankful for the money and personally thanked us on the last morning of our stay. Although the location was the farthest away from the Magic Kingdom, it really only amounted to about 15 mins. by car. Not sure how long on a bus. It was very secluded. There was a McDonald's close by but it seemed to have \"tourist prices\". The parking lot was very large and required a bit of a hike up the hill if you didn't park near the front. What we liked the most was having the African experience and feeling like you were actually in some of the countries there, also the fact, you could spend your entire stay right at the hotel and have something to see or do. The villa next door also had tennis courts and basketball. If there was something that we didn't like so much, it would have to be the size of the room. The pillows were also very tall and my neck started hurting after a couple days. Also, you had to pay for the internet ($14/day). At the prices they charge, it should really be included. What was nice in the room was the fact the air conditioner was very quiet which makes a change from many hotel rooms. We also used the laundry facilities too. That seems to have covered most of the hotel. It really did add a great deal of pleasure to our whole Disney experience. After a long, hot tiring day out at the parks, it was great to be able to come back here. The security guard would even say that each time you came back , \"Welcome Home\".

On the way back it was the same. Not a big deal (and we carried a stroller). It was my daughters birthday so the 1st night mickey left her a voice mail with happy birthday, on the 2nd night they left a card from micky in the room with a small cake. Disney did a good job. Great free self parking too. The only issue is with the price of the rooms...a 3 night stay durring peak would have been almost $1500, good thing we only paid 1/2 other wise you can find cheeper.

The attention to detail in the architecture is second to none, as is the service. The rooms are not large, but are beautifully furnished in African style. I found the bed a little hard but I suppose that's a question of taste. We were able to use the pool at Kidani Village aswell as the one at Jambo Lodge which made a nice change and meant that neither pool was too busy. The Mara foodcourt was fairly priced for Disney and had a good selection (not just the usual burger and pizza), however beware of the buffet breakfast at Boma.

It was over 1,000 steps to the front door from our room. This doesn't sound all that terrible - but when you forget something in your room and don't realize it until you are at the bus stop, or consider that all of the dining options are on the OTHER side of the resort, or you have spent the entire day walking in a park - you will realize that this resort is extremely LARGE. We had reserved a Savanna view room, and our view was of the Arusha Savanna. You WILL see animals - but keep in mind that animals and humans have different schedules! Very early morning and early afternoon/evening is when we saw animals. It doesn't get any better than seeing a giraffe first thing in the morning, feeding outside your room! It's quite incredible! As far as the service - the front desk staff wasn't all that great. The young lady that checked us in was really unsure of everything. She didn't have definitive answers to any of our questions. Later during the week we stopped by to change a dining reservation, we really had a tough time working with the guy at the front desk. The hallways leading to our room were not clean, there was a lot of dust and dirt in the corners - and a lot of the lower wallpaper was damaged from the mousekeeping carts. When the decor of the hotel is meant to look a little worn, there is a fine line between worn - and dirty. We bought refillable mugs - but we always had to take them with us in the morning if we didn't want to walk 2,000+ steps round to the counter service location. It is a LONG walk! The pool is great - but you may want to consider taking clothes and changing in the pool locker rooms if you are assigned a room on the Kudu Trail as it's not fun going all the way from the Kudu Trail to the Pool and back in wet clothes, wet sandals etc. As with all the Disney Resorts the toiletry amenities are great - the H20 brand products are great! All in all - this resort is beautiful, and it has a lot of really unique benefits, opportunities, and features that are not available at any other resort.... let alone a Walt Disney World Resort. While it's not our favorite resort (Wilderness Lodge is!) it's a great place to stay, and does have a lot in common with Wilderness Lodge, it just isn't the same! We have stayed at several Disney hotels, and this just wasn't on par with the rest. The animals are a big draw, but you can go see the animals even if you aren't staying at AKL.

This resort is just amazing as soon as you start driving towards the main gate you know you are about to see something special. As soon as you see Jambo House you'll know what I mean!!! When you walk through the massive entrance into the huge lobby that has so much to look at you wont know where to begin. We were treated exceptionally from the begin we had separate park tickets that we purchased before leaving for the US and I remember from previous visits as child/teenager that you can combine your room key with your Disney Pass I enquired about this and before I knew it they had already done it on reception for me. The receptionist was very nice and was brimming with information although as a frequent visitor growing up I knew a lot of the information needed she asked us about ourselves and our visit and really made a fuss about us after we told her about it being our honeymoon. She gave us the just married pins and some additional pins which came in handy later on in trip with loads of express passes and being greeted with \"Congratulations\" from every cast member and other visitors alike. I was hoping for a free upgrade but I think we lucked out on that one but our room was amazing none the less. I will always love the Disney little touches to improve your stay being welcomed when entering the hotel by a cast member with them saying \"Welcome Home\" every time you entered. The towel creations made by the maids everyday from the love birds to the Mickey mouse head we couldn't wait to get back to see the next creation. We were never disturbed by guest services they came in cleaned and changed the linen without us even knowing. The rooms were always cleaned to a high standard. We dined at Boma, Jiko and the Mara. All had a great variety of food and had some extremely amazing dishes. At Boma our waiter gave us a free mini selection of mini deserts which were out of this world. Jiko is by far the best restaurant at WDW amazing food and wine selection. At Jiko our waitress was amazingly nice and saw that we were on our honeymoon so gave us a free bottle of wine and Evian during our meal. You must also take advantage of the night vision animal watching that is run in the late evening you will spend a very long time watching the giraffe's and other animals grazing in the Savannah. The pool, spa's and gym were all great although we didn't pay that many visits to them. Although it was nice to take a dip in the spa or the pool after a hard day at the parks. People moan about the price of staying here but I say you get what you pay for. They also moan about it being to far away by transport it is further out than some resorts but it is not that noticeable when on the highly entertaining Disney transport. Yes this hotel is not the cheapest option by any means but it was worth every penny. Unfortunately now on our future visits to see the Mouse my wife will not stay anywhere else and to be honest I don't either. lol. . We loved every minute of it. Would we recommend to a friend ?

We had a very long journey as we got a connecting flight (with Delta who were amazing) and used Disney\u2019s Magical Express service from MCO and we arrived at AKL at around 8.30pm. When we were checking in I mentioned it was a special trip for us (wedding planning) and cheekily asked if there was any possibility of upgrading to a Savannah View room. The check in lady looked at me a little confused and said we already had a Savannah View \u2013 result! We had the most amazing room location, if they had given us a map of the resort and said \u2018choose your room\u2019 it would have been very close by! We were less than a minute from the lobby overlooking the main (Arusha) savannah. And close enough to the Arusha overlook that if we opened our balcony door we could hear the African music that they play from the back of the lobby. Magical! Our room was the best Disney Resort room we\u2019ve had (also stayed at Disneyland Paris resorts \u2013 Hotel New York, Disneyland Hotel and Sequoia Lodge) and mousekeeping were amazing. We had lovely towel animals and an awesome congratulations card from Mickey and Minnie. Everyday we saw loads of animals, and there was a cow/antelope guy who would come within 2 feet of our balcony as he was smart enough to get past the fence so he could eat and sleep in a certain bush he liked. Before our trip I was a little worried about the bus service to the parks (we didn\u2019t rent a car) as on a map the Resort is far out from the rest of WDW but we never waited long (except for Downtown Disney/Typhoon Lagoon buses which were sometimes 20 minutes) and the longest journey to the Magic Kingdom was only around 15 minutes. We ate at all 3 restaurants, we thought the Mara (quick service) was great, and offered a good selection, we had breakfast and dinner at Boma (buffet) we really enjoyed dinner but weren\u2019t too impressed with breakfast. The best meal of our trip was in Jiko (Signature restaurant) the service was amazing and food was fresh and delicious, we\u2019ll definitely be back. The staff (like in all of Disneyworld) were second to none, on our arrival night my fianc\u00e9 had a bad headache, so I ventured out on my own to find the restaurant and buy us some drinks and snacks, as I got to the lobby I saw a Cast Member and asked him the way to the Mara, he walked me the whole way and we had a great conversation. On another occasion we asked the concierge desk if there was any possibility of seeing the suites as we were considering staying there again for our wedding trip, they were so helpful and showed us the beautiful vice presidential suite and also advised us to go over to Kidani Village to see the 1 bedroom villas. Kidani is a short 10 minute walk away and is definitely worth visiting, the lobby is like a small version of Jambo house and is beautifully done. We loved everything about Animal Kingdom Lodge, but the question is \u201cwill we be back?\u201d.... We\u2019ve rebooked already! This time we have opted to pay the extra for a Savannah view as it was so amazing looking over the main savannah that we wanted to benefit of being able to request an Arusha view room. This is for the first 5 nights of our wedding and honeymoon trip and we have raved about AKL so much that our family and friends have also booked to stay at the resort. We can\u2019t wait to be back!

Regardless of the level of accommodation you choose, you will truly enjoy your \"Disney Experience\". This time around at the Animal Kingdom, Disney did not fail to disappoint. Rooms: Spacious, clean, comfortable beds/pillows! The balcony and views of the animals was a truly unique experience that could be enjoyed by guests of all ages. The property was quite large and we had one of the rooms at the very end of the property so it was a bit of a hike (especially after full days of walking) but it was very quiet and private! Staff: I would love to attend an orientation for Disney employees, they are all so friendly and welcoming regardless of their position. Their Disney personality shines through and makes the experience enjoyable. Activities: It was cool to see how many activities they had for children at the resort, just when you felt you had too much to do, Disney throws a few more things your way. Food: Did not eat at the resort for dinner, had a snack - I'm a picky eater and do not like spicy food, I had a pizza with spices on it that I could not handle, but me knowing my eating habits I should have just ordered a cheese pizza - ha, ha!

Free transportation anywhere on the property and the Disney Magical Express is yet another added value option, frequent buses coming to and from the hotel - rarely had to wait longer than 5 minutes, and we were there on off season.

The seemed to be running very frquently and late into the night which is great if you are watching one of the firework shows etc. The only slightly negative comment that I would have is that the pool area can get very overcrowed and the pool itself isn't that big considering the overall size of the hotel.

Whenever I read about Animal Kingdom Lodge, review after review mentioned the bus service to and from Magic Kindom. Needless to say, I was a bit hesitant and worried that we would be spending half our trip waiting on buses/riding buses. Either we had impeccable timing each time we caught a bus, or Disneyworld bought more busses to shuttle between the hotel and magic kingdom. Not once did we wait more than a couple of minutes for a bus. With that being said, it is true that Animal Kingdom is farther away than anything else, but I knew that going in, so it didn't bother me. One piece of advice....thank the bus drivers, and make sure your kids do as well. First of all, it's the polite thing to do, and they work hard and do a good job. Second, sometimes they have little trinkets in their pockets to give to kids. As it relates to the rest of the trip, my wife and I are convinced Disney has thought of everything when they planned the Disneyworld complex. The greatest was the Magical Express to and from airport. If you are traveling with kids, or if your wife packs too much, you need to sign up for this. It made our airport portions of the trip much less stressful. At Animal Kingdom, make sure to get the savannah view...it is worth it. our kids loved waking up in the morning and going out on balcony to say good morning to the animals.

We booked out trip through DreamMakers Vacation. Lynda is the Disney specialist and provided great support and information through our booking process! She helped with restaurant reservations, booking changes, and information about all of the Disney properties. Another bonus is that if you refer family or friends to DreamMakers, they offer you a gift card as a thank you for referring their service. When looking for a hotel/resort to stay at during vacation, rooms and cleanliness are VERY important to me. I know people say that you don't spend a lot of time in the room, however, for me it is critical that the room is clean, well maintained, decent decor, and good service. I found all to be the case at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge. My family and I consisting of myself, my husband, and a 3 and 1 year old stayed at the main lodge along with my sister's family who were in a room across the hall (She also has a 3 and 2 year old) back in April and we all had a wonderful stay. The PROS are as follows: -Listed as Deluxe Property -Clean Room -Seeing the Animals - We had a partial Savannah view room. Every morning/day we saw all types of exoctic animals including Zebras, Giraffes, Gazels, Antelope, and some animals I dind't even recognize! The children loved it! It was a daily trip to the zoo! -Great Customer Service (The mini fridge in our room wasn't working and one of the wonderful folks in housekeeping came to help fix the problem. The temp control just needed to be turned down to allow the ice to thaw. In the meantime she brought a container full of ice for us to keep the water, juice, and milk we brought for the children) -More on Great Serive - We used Disney's Magical Express to and from the hotel so we wouldn't have to manage our bags and the children. The hotel has a airline and baggage check in right in the front. You can check in your bags there and again not have to carry the luggage to the airport. The day before our departure, the Magical Express Service had our boarding passes AND luggage tags printed out. All we had to do was to take the bags downstairs, get them weighed, and wait for our shuttle. Even if you don't take the Magical Express, the luggage and airline check in is available for guests of the hotel -Great Restaurants - We were on the dining plan which consisted of 1 Snack, 1 Quick Serivce, and 1 Sit Down meal per day per person (excluding the 1 year old who you don't have to pay for) The restaurants in the hotel were wonderful! Mara was the quick service which just means it's cafeteria style. But the food was good and they always had plenty of options! Jiko was the fine dining. We ate there our first night and used up 2 of our sit down meals a peice for this treat. The food was excellent as well as the atmosphere and ambiance. Keep in mind we were dining with a 3 and 1 year old in an enviornment which reminds me a little of steakhouse and the servers were all VERY accommodating to the children and no one (including the staff and other diners) seemed to mind the baby's talking during the meal. Finally Boma is the buffet. We had dinner there one night and breakfast on the day of departure! Excellent cuisine! Animal Lodge has an African Theme and all of the restaurants offered cuisine from Africa. However, diners will be delighted to find that you had many choices including a Kid's section of the buffet which had chicken fingers, french fries, mini pizzas, etc. These were options as well as the falafel, cous cous, salmon, and some other ethnic dishes from that region. All the restaurants were great! TIP ON RESTAURANTS - If you are okay planning some of your tirp, make your meal time reservations for the sit down meals in advance. Even if you call the same day it's better to have the reservation to guarantee quick seating if the restaurant happens to be crowded at that particular time. We didn't have a problem with walking up but reservations are great and pretty much accepted everywhere except the quick service dining areas. Location - Disney's Animal Kingdon is obviously the closest Theme park to the lodge. However, the shuttle service was excellent. We never waited more than 10 or 15 minutes for a shuttle. Plus the hotel had shuttle stops to Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, one of the Water Parks, and Downtwon Disney. These were all of the places we were interested in going to. Given we didnt' have a rental car (by design) we got everywhere we wanted to go easily with the children. -POOL The pool was great especially for young children and had a great water slide. They also offered free floating vests and had them in different sizes from babies, to toddlers, to older children! I thought that was great! CONS: Really not many. I thought the hotel was great. The rooms were a little small but we had two children and a crib. Upon check in we inquired about getting an upgrade which the representative happily looked into for us. If we wanted to pay more money we could have received the upgrade. The villas side may have had more room but is a bit of a walk to the main lodge where all of the main restaurants are located. This would not have been a problem if we didn't have the smaller children WI-FI The only other conern was that you had to pay to get internet access. There was a daily fee of over $10.

We are talking watermelon and beet salad with tandoori chicken. No joke. It did not appeal to us so we ate every meal off site. The tv in the room has NO movie channels. You cannot get any on-demand or pay movies. The pool was overcrowded with kids. And lastly, the hotel overlooks a savanna with animals...this is why people come here. The animals are fun to watch but don't expect a whole herd to gallop towards your window. We had one lone wildebeast that grazed nearby. If your looking to be entertained by the animals, you will be...for about 10 minutes. In conclusion, this was not the romantic getaway we had in mind.

This was zen at Disney!\u201d", "Author": "alliecallie", "ReviewID": "UR64387932", "Content": "Just got back from a 9 day stay May 7- May 16 and my sister had to peel me out of the hotel to get on the bus to go home. This resort was breathtaking, fun, and relaxing all at the same time. I took this trip with my sister age 24 and I am 27. Have stayed on Disney property many times but this was my first time at AKL. (see my profile for review on Carribean Beach). I'll start my review with an awesome money saving tip! Since I was staying for 9 nights there was a huge price difference for a savannah view vs a pool view. I booked the pool view, but I also booked the Waynama safari. All safaris are for concierge guests- but Waynama is open to ANY guest of the lodge. It was $175 per person, and we got to see EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL AT THE LODGE UP CLOSE!! You get in an open 'bus'/trailer with bench seating. The tour is limited to 12 people so you get to have all of your questions answered on the animals. You get to see the barns where they keep the animals, learn all the animals names, and fun facts about them. (like one animal had sinus problems and has seen 3 different ENTs for it, and learn which animals are pregnant, etc). They pulled the truck RIGHT up to the animals and you got to take pictures of them- no zoom required! The safari also included dinner at Jinko (will talk about later in review). We saved a lot of money having the pool view and still got to see animals and learn so much about them! As for the pool view I was on the 3rd floor of Zebra trail. I didn't know what floor to ask for when I booked (Disney will often honor such requests if they can) but I was THRILLED with the 3rd floor. When you walk into the lodge you are on the 3rd floor- so I had no stairs/elevators to get to my room at night. Pool and all dining is on first floor but 2 flights of stairs is not bad at all! (we choose stairs over elevator to try and walk off that dining plan!) Our room was spotless and mouse keeping was wonderful. The pool view was very nice- of course we are in our 20s so the sight of a pool bar is a gorgeous site to us! :) It was a very quite room- even though the pool is open 24 hours- never really had any problems with noise. As with all disney resorts I could hear other peoples toilets flush, but never talking, tv, etc. I had read on Trip Advisor that the rooms are very dark. This is true- but only a problem at night. Its very dim in the lodge in the evening so the animals can have their normal sleep cycle. (thats what our safari guide told us). I enjoyed coming home to a quiet place in the evening- it was relaxing walking back to your room. If you will need to put on make up at night- bring a mirror with a light. Or if you have small kids afraid of the dark- a night light to plug in. Leaving your curtains open won't be a lot of light. During the day we just did our make up by the patio window (they have a table by it) and we had no problems at all with the lighting. We ate in all 3 restaruants that AKL had to offer. (we were on disney dining plan) Mara is the quick service location and is more of a food court. Breakfast was your standard mickey waffles, eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and an assortment of rolls and muffins. Lunch and dinner were not my favorite at this location. I tried the cheese flatbread but it was literally cheese with little to no sauce on a cracker. It wasn't filling or tasty. Another night I tried a chicken pita which was better- but nothing to rave about. My sister is a vegan and had a hard time finding things here because even the hummus had cheese in it. If you are self pay breakfast was ~$6 per adult, lunch and dinner ~$12-15 per adult Bohma was the buffett place and we ate breakfast here twice. (if self pay breakfast was I believe ~$30 per adult). It was really good- it did not have a lot of \"african\" offerings at breakfast (I hear it does at dinner) but they had scrambled eggs with goat cheese and chives (AMAZING) and an African oatmeal that is high in protein. Otherwise, it had standard breakfast fare, eggs, omlets made to order, pancakes, waffles, cereal, fruit, yougart, etc. Jinko is the place you HAVE to eat at it you stay at this hotel. We got to eat here after the safari and it was so good I made my sister go back! This place is very expensive if you are paying out of pocket (~$50 per adult) and costs 2 meals on the dining plan. It is WORTH it! Tried the nan with the spreads (hummus) and I could have licked the bowl clean. Had the steak with mac and cheese- and its the best steak in disney world! (beats canada Le Cellier in my opinion!) If you are looking for a place to really treat yourself- this is it! The most common complaint I had read in trip reports was the busses. It is true- bus rides are longer from this resort then more centralized resorts, however, only by 5 or 10 minutes. My sister and I were there 9 days and NEVER waited more then 15 minutes for a bus. NEVER. You only have 2 bus stops at AKL- Kidani villiage and Jambo house. Kidani village is the vacation club place, and Jamo house is the big lodge itself. 2 bus stops is not a big deal at all. Especially after last year being at CBR. I don't think there are many disney resorts that Don't have more then one bus stop. Yacht club and beach club share a bus, Boardwalk and Swan and Dolphin share a bus, Polynesian and Contomparay share a bus, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge share a bus, and then the moderates all have numerous stops with in them. So more then one bus stop is next to impossible to avoid unless you stay at Pop. One other thing that I LOVED about this resort were the cast members. Many of them grew up in Africa and gave power points about their home towns, or did presentations on the animals of their country. They were all so engaging and I learned so much about Africa from them! I also can tell the difference between a cheetah, jaguar, and lepord. The only negative thing I have to say about this lodge was I had a little bit of trouble with the front desk. I got sick with a sinus infection the last 3 days. I found a pharmacy that delievers (Turner Drug) and the front desk said they would call my room when my medicine arrives. Noone ever called, and when I went to the desk to ask them they could not find my medicine. I am a pharmacist- and so I was pretty confident that the pharmacy had delievered it. I called them and they said they had. It took the cast memeber 2 trips to the back before they found it- but they did find it. The cast member was nice about it- but being sick and miserable I just wanted my medicine. Over all animal kingdom lodge was beautiful. You can look at pictures, but until you are standing in the lobby, over looking the savannah, you can't appericate the beauty and detail. My sister and I wanted to try a new hotel every trip- but it will be hard not to stay at this hotel again. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. : )", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alma, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWe LOVED it!\u201d", "Author": "JoMich", "ReviewID": "UR64163391", "Content": "My husband, two daughters (11 and 17) and I stayed at AK Lodge last August and loved it!

It is a beautifully designed hotel which really transports you out of the whole Disney mindframe. I believe what really makes the hotel special is having the Savannah room and having the children be able to wake up to the sight of the animals. We would bring some breakfast food from the concierge level and let them eat breakfast on the balcony while watching giraffe, zebra and other animals, they really got excited about this. Animals were almost always visable, anytime of day. The rooms are small and dark, but the \"dark\" kind of fits with the Dark Continent theme of the hotel. Really, my only complaint of the hotel is the bus transportation home from parks. As people mentioned earlier it is not really an issue in the mornng getting to the paks but getting home is terrible. There seems to be fewer buses to AKL than other hotels even though it is the only Disney transportation available (no boat, monorail, etc). Also, it stops at the village first and usually picks up passengers to bring back to the main lodge. For instance, it took us over 45 minutes to get back from Animal Kingdom on day after waiting for the bus and taking over 10 minutes to load passengers to go back to Jambo House. (Disney, please put in a small dedicated shuttle to get people between the 2 if they need it) I am convinced it would have been faster to walk. One last thing on the transportation, if you are taking the Magic Express from the airport, be aware thet stop at 3 hotels before you get to AKL and then you stop at the village 1st as well. Really for a deluxe hotel I think they should have a different route. All and all, I think for parents traveling with younger children who would really would really get a kick out of being so close to the animals, AKL is a fantastic choice. PS- We had great meals at Jiko and ate there multiple diners and there is a pool with a slide at the main lodge but from what I gather it is not as elobrate as the village or some other hotels but it was plenty fine for the younger children that I think the hotel caters too.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cTypical Disney Resort, just a bit better\u201d", "Author": "Beaker40", "ReviewID": "UR63774779", "Content": "We've been to Disney a million time and usually stay in one of the \"Deluxe\" resorts, if not the Cabins at Fort Wilderness (still my all time favorite).

It was my 25th wedding anniversary with my husband and we spared no expense to make this a wonderful lasting memory. I researched for months, read many books and watched alot of reviews to have the most knowledge about Disney as I could to make a decision about our visit and finally wanted to stay at the Animal Kindgom Lodge. I thought it would so cool to watch the animals from our balcony on the Savannah view. I must say that I am a very low maintainance person and was disappointed with my stay here. We saved our money to go on this trip and it was not worth all the hype for this hotel. It was not until the 3rd day that we even saw any animals except some pelicans and a few birds and would not pay the extra money for this perk. There are plenty of public viewing areas and the little time you spend in the room coupled with the fact that the animals are far away and never out close to your room made me frustrated. We were up all times of the day also to try to catch the animals. We were on the Zebra trail and maybe there are some savannahs that are better than others but the pictures are not quite accurate. In order to get pictures of the animals up close I had to leave my room and run down to the public viewing area and snap some shots. That was crazy to me. That being said it was a beautiful hotel. Lobby very impressive. Very cool theming. Staff very nice and helpful. The restaurants were great. The pool was beautiful with lots of seating but we didn't use the pool. The rooms were nice. Beds comfy. Shower great. Mouse keeping was so good that with dusting under the tv they disconnected the tv and there was no manuel way of turning it on and it took 5 hours and 3 calls to front desk to get it fixed. It took 2 seconds for them to fix it. They told us we had to be in the room to do this so the one night that we wanted to explore the different savannahs was wasted in our room waiting for someone to fix the tv. They apologized for this and probably would have done compensation but I didn't want that, I just wanted my time back and my tv fixed sooner. The gift shop is awesome and and the buses were great going but not coming home. Never had to wait long on the buses to take us to the parks but had to wait long amounts of time to get the buses from the parks home. One night at magic kindom after fireworks we waited 40 minutes for a bus to come and load and then another 20 minutes to get to the hotel. We left early from Fantasmic to \"beat the crowd\" out of the park home from Hollywood Studios and had to wait 35 minutes to get a bus. It seemed as though they only had 1 bus running to our hotel when I saw multiple buses picking up for other hotels and there were long lines for people to go back to Animal Kingdom Lodge. I'm glad we stayed here to say we did, but out of all the places I could have stayed for the same money I wouldn't stay here again. It is still Disney and they do alot of things right. They try to think of everything from the dining plan to magical express, airline check in from the hotel, and everyone wishing us a Happy Anniversary due to the 25 year buttons they gave us to wear saying Happy Anniversary with Mickey and Minnie.

It simply didn't live up to the hype. I've stayed at nearly all of the Disney hotels, and this one fared on the low side. Everything was very, very dark... the room was so dim you couldn't read a book. The pool was satisfactory, but not nearly as elaborate as many of its competitors.

Everything about this hotel is fabulous from the rooms, to the animals and everything else in between. The studio room was beautifully themed, we had a pool view which was lovely with very comfortable beds and a flat screen TV. The usual separate wash basins, bath and toilet. As it was a DVC studio we had a small sink, fridge, coffee machine and toaster, crockery etc. - very useful. There was also an ironing board, an iron and a safe. We ate at Mara, Boma and Jiko and the meals in all were great. The shop has a varied and wide choice of goods with additional day to day things e.g. food, plasters, pain killers etc. The staff in the shop go 'the extra mile' to help you purchase or locate something special. The pool is large with life guards, plenty of sun beds, a slide and jacuzzis, sun and shade can be found as necessary. Free laundry facilities and internet access are available to DVC members. There are viewing spots throughout the property to see the animals, which of course are the 'stars of the show'! A stroll among the savannah sections almost always allowed the animals to be seen, so if a savannah view is out of your price range, don't panic as the animals are there for everyone to see. Yes, it is a longer trip to the Magic Kingdom but still no more than 20 minutes at the worst and it is worth the longer bus trip to be staying there. It's not that far to any of the other parks.

Once checked in we could go straight to the park, they would deliver our luggage to our room. We were running late to our Disney dinning reservation in Hollywood Studios so the hotel called ahead to save us. Buses for AKL don\u2019t stop at other hotels but the time to MK does take 15-20 min. When we got back to the room the view wasn\u2019t so great so we asked the front desk if we could have a better view, no problem they changed rooms right away and we were very pleased (rm 4517). The instant we got there a Giraffe was at our balcony & a Wildebeest was napping just under it incredible, you really feel like your somewhere special we forgot we were in Florida our daughter couldn\u2019t wait to wake up in the morning to see what animal was stopping by to say hi. Very clean plenty of room for the 4 of us , with a fridge & table for snacks. It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask to change rooms if you don\u2019t like the one they give you, it worked out great for us! The lobby is breath taking and they have little sitting areas just to hang out and an area set up with a TV like a family room. The shop is nice and also has a little food mart in it to stock up that fridge with drinks & snacks. As for the food we only ate at Boma for breakfast and it was fantastic I\u2019m a personal Chef so I can be very critical about restaurants. We ate at several other restaurants on the Deluxe dining plan the only complaint was every place is slow give yourself at least 2 \u00bd hrs for table service not sure why as all the restaurants have a set menu with only a few choices. The Coral Reef was everyone\u2019s favorite. The hallways are large and open in some areas for viewing the Savanna , the resort is kinda shaped like a giant horseshoe with the Lobby at the bottom it is very large but it didn\u2019t seem to take long to get around. My mother In law couldn\u2019t do a lot of walking so we rented a Stay Cool scooter from AA Tourist Rentals, they delivered it to the hotel and we charged it right outside or hotel room door.

On both trips we have been upgraded to a Savannah view room free of charge. Ten days prior to our reservation date, I contacted the hotel direct and requested a free upgrade. Although rooms aren't allocated until the day of arrival, I was told that my request had been noted. I'm not sure it made any difference, but we did get the upgrade so I would say it's worth a try (you don't get if you don't ask). The hotel is beautifully themed and all of the staff extremely helpful. When we checked into the hotel, we told the cast member on reception that it was our 4 year olds first trip to Disney World. He made a huge fuss of our son and gave him a 'first visit' badge and some stickers. Needless to say that (combined with the free room upgrade) got our holiday off to a great start. There are lots of activities for small children and African Guides are always on hand to answer any questions. One of the guides spent time with my 4 year old, writing Swahili and Zulu words in his Epcot passport. The food in the hotel is of good quality (even in the quck service restaurant). It can be quite a walk fom the lobby to your hotel room, but it's worth it when you get to see Zebra and Giraffe walking past your window. The location of the hotel is both a plus and minus. Although the hotel is quite a way from the parks, obviously with the exception of Animal Kingdom Park, it is only a mile away from a whole host of shops, supermarkets and restaurants located on the Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway. I would recommend hiring a car as the bus transportation is slowed by the addition of the Kidani Village. The bus now dives past Jambo House to pick up and drop off at Kidani first. This is an inconvenience when being collected in the morning as the bus sometimes arrived almost full. After a tiring day in the parks, it was also an irritation to have to drive past Jambo House to have to drop off other guests first. Security within the resort is excellent. Each time you return to the hotel, you are stopped at a security point and asked to show your room key or photo ID. Each time your identity is validated the cast members greet you by saying 'Welcome Home' and after a few days, you really do feel as if you have come home. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who enjoys feeling that extra bit special when on holiday.

I'm not sure how a family with lots of luggage would manage. You are paying a lot for these rooms, because they are Disney rooms - but the bathroom part of the Animal Kingdom Lodge rooms remind me of less expensive motel bathrooms. Bathroom was not outright dirty, but could have used a good cleaning. Walls were splattered with assorted things (toothpaste? cosmetics? hairstuff? who knows what?). Room location - We were at end of hallway and it was really quiet. Walk from the lobby took about 5 minutes. Savanna view was average. I'd recommend staying closer to the main part of lodge. Service - absolutely exceptional! The cultural programs, with representatives from various countries in Africa, were wonderful. Dining - We ate at Jiko, Boma, and Saana. All were wonderful, with great food and great service. The fast food type restaurant (Mara) was just average, nothing really special.

The atmosphere was great and my kids (aged 14 and 4) loved the safari animals. We booked a standard room and are glad we didn't upgrade-- we were rarely in our rooms long enough to have enjoyed a more expensive view. Plus, there are so many observation areas around the hotel that you are sure to see plenty of animals without having to pay the extra money for a Savahanna view. The pool was what really made this hotel great. The zero depth pool really made it feel like you are swimming in a watering hole. It was never overly crowded and the waterslide was perfect for both of my boys. Again they rarely had to wait in a long line to go down the water slide. Word of warning though -- we went in August and there was pretty much an afternoon thunderstorm every day. They will make everyone get out of the pool if there is thunder and lightening. So be prepared to take a little break and return later. The food was EXPENSIVE!! We did not purchase any of the Disney dining plan options. Next time we will. We primarily ate at the Mara cafe (Quick service) because the other restaurants seemed to have a long wait and were much more expensive. The Mara was okay though limited in choices if you eat there pretty much every morning. What we didn't know is that the room had a refrigerator and there is a staple of food supplies that you can purchase at the gift shop. We didn't realize this until about 4 days into our trip. The food supply area is kind of off to the side of the gift shop and you could easily miss it. So I recommend stocking up when you get there if you don't want to spend tons of money on food. Transportation -- it took a LONG time to get to the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Downtown area. So be prepared. We tried to take advantage of the early magic hours ... well it seems that everyone else was as well so the buses get crowded. Especially to the Magic Kingdom. If you use Disney's Magical Express-- Animal Kingdom Lodge is the very LAST stop on the way in, and the first stop on the way out. So basically, be prepared to be on that bus for an hour or more. That took a while. It was very convinient, but definitely took a while. The room was fine. I guess for the price you expect more, but it wasn't bad. The beds were really, really squeeky and noisy though. The first night we didn't get much sleep but after that we were all so tired from having been at the parks all day we slept fine. There are a couple of laundry rooms that came in handy as well. We used these at least twice. It was quite a walk from our room, but worth it to not have to pack as many clothes and get to wash them. We brought our own laundry supplies (those new detergent/softner sheets are small to pack and worked great!).

The room itself had two queen sized beds, a small desk & chair, a cabinet with the tv and a small fridge.

The bathroom was absolutely tiny with just the bath/shower & toilet in a separate room. The vanity was open space adjoining the bedroom.

I opted for the Animal Kingdom Lodge since I had stayed there 2 previous times with enjoyable results. Unfortunately, this time was not as great.

It was located overlooking a parking lot and directly next to an ice vending machine. I heard the ice drop while unloading our bags and immediately asked to move. The front desk granted me request and moved me to a room that had some bamboo in front of the balcony. (Little did I know that my room was directly above the designated outdoor smoking area.) While my son slept in the first morning I stepped outside to read the paper and have coffee on the balcony. The smoking area had 12 smokers enjoying their morning ritual too. I went back inside to the dark room and tried not to wake up my exhausted son. On day 2 I found peanuts behind a chair I moved. That would normally not bother me except that my son has a life threatening food allergy to peanuts. I quickly picked them up and flushed them down the toilet. I shudder to think what would have happened had he found them first. The room itself is nicely appointed. It's a nice touch to have a small fridge in the room and a coffee maker. The bathroom has double sinks too. The beds were comfortable and having a balcony was an added bonus...minus the location. Where this Disney property falls down on the job is its front desk. All 3 times I have stayed here I have been displeased with the attitude of the front desk employees. They have all been competent, but never friendly or accommodating. Overall, this hotel is worth its premium priceonly if you have the savana view room. Without it, you might as well stay at a moderate resort.

There are a ton of activities for children and adults- just ask for a guide when you check in.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire", "Title": "\u201cAnimal Kingdom Lodge WOW\u201d", "Author": "Macl1uk", "ReviewID": "UR57821847", "Content": "Staying at Animal Kingdom Lodge is like having two different holidays at the same time, at the hotel you could be in Africa not in the middle of Disney. The hotel is thatched and everything is themed around Africa including the food. Zawadi Marketplace - the gift shop has a great selection of African artefacts including drums, Ostrich eggs, carved elephants, beads and there a few Disney gifts. Animal Kingdom Lodge is a fantastic hotel and there are plenty of viewing areas around the hotel to see the animals. We have recently returned from Animal Kingdom Lodge and this was out third time there. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is magical. We love Animal Kingdom Lodge in 2004 we stayed 16 nights and had a fantastic view of the Uzima Savannah even though we only paid the standard rate. In 2006 we returned for 21 nights and were initially given a room overlooking the car park, soon swapped to the Sunset Savannah, view was not fantastic, but again I only paid the standard room rate. 2009 we stayed for 15 nights and had a fantastic Savannah room (this time we paid for the upgrade). Each room has a reasonable size fridge (empty), a large TV and DVD player, coffee/tea making facilities, a mini wall safe and the usual hairdryer. I would recommend that you hire a car for the full period, especially staying at this hotel. Besides it being isolated, it is also expensive to eat at. This time we only ate at Mara in the hotel (self service), the rest of the time we ate off site. Boma was expensive in 2006 \u2013 we could have 2 meals at TGI Fridays for the price of one at Boma. At Easter 2009, one English couple with two kids had a meal there with a bottle of wine the total bill was USD150. Mara is the self service restaurant down by the pool, it is open from about 6am to 11pm, the lunch/evening menu includes stews, seafood platter & chips, burgers, pizzas, chapatti filled with ham, chicken nuggets as well as a reasonable selection of salads and fruit. They also sell refillable mugs which cost about USD13 each and you can refill them with hot and cold drinks (excluding juices) as many times as you like at your hotel during your stay and they are a great souvenir to take home, this compares with a charge per drink of USD2.50 if you do not use the refillable mugs. Unfortunately you cannot refill them in the parks. We love sitting on the balcony watching the Giraffes, Zebra, Thomson Gazelle, Bongos, Wildebeest, Blesbok, Eland, Impala and a whole host of other animals. Also down by the pool are Flamingos. The theme is African and very little to indicate that you might be in a Disney hotel. Our daughter loves the place and painting ostrich eggs. I am up early watching the animals being fed by the hotel; I get some fantastic close-up photos of the animals. The pool is designed for kids, so the deepest area is about 5\u00bd feet and gradually goes from a very shallow area to the deep area. There is also a good waterslide. Down by the pool there are two hot tubs and showers and changing rooms. Towels are provided free and can be found in portable bins, also life jackets are provided for non swimmers. The games room by the pool will keep any child happy for hours, with slot machines, air hockey & racing games. From memory we had to vacate our room by 11am on the day of departure, we took our cases to Downtown Disney as we were flying with Virgin and returned to the hotel and used the pool, later showering and changing for our flight home.

The room are amazingly clean. We didnt find one speck of dust in the room for the two weeks that we were there! The resteraunt wasnt like a posh hotel resteraunt, but the food was nice and the staff there were very friendly. When me and my brother went down to get hot chocolate or something like that, it was about 5 dollars for the both of them (expensive, i know) and we only had about 3 dollars, they let us have them, and didnt even make us pay them back the next day, even though my dad tried to! It is nice and it fills you up, and is much better than paying a lot for a 'high class' meal in the resteraunt downstairs. The thing about the mara is, there is only 3 dinner and breakfast and they get a bit boring after a while. For breakfast i say you should have bacon with a waffle and drown it all in maple syrup! Sounds disgusting but its lush, honest. The hotel makes you feel very at home and friendly, and it has a very comfortable atmosfere. The caricature man or woman is very good, and he will even frame your pictures for you! Animal Kingdom is quite far away from the parks, especially universal. It took us about an hour to get there, but it was well worth it! I also recomend you not to waste your time and money on seaworld, as the only good thing there is the whale show which has probably put lots of people off because of the little killing incident recently. The journey from Bristol airport is 12 hours, so i would prepare yourself well! Hollywood studios was my favourite park, defo. The shop in the Animal Kingdom Lodge is really nice, with everything that you would want and need... well, you shouldnt need anything at all in this hotel! You seriously get what you pay for! The beds are extremely comfy, and made you want to sleep early which is easier to get up early! The buses for the parks are running all day long so if your tired and want a lie in or a relaxing swim in the pool or spa session you can go to the parks in the night or the afternoon. The african theme is very cool and disney! Last word: Rent a car... it;s much cheaper, quicker and easier than to catch a taxi or bus to universal or the shopping malls!

But we also did our homework and when traveling to Disneyworld it is necessary! I bought several of the books recommended (Passporter) to make our stay the best it could be (available on Amazon or at Borders). I knew to book a One Bedroom Savannah Family Suite with a kitchen (plates, glasses, toaster dishwasher included) at the Jambo House (even though I am not a DVC Member they are available and very spacious). We had a king bed and the family room had a pullout double couch and a pullout chair twin bed and washing machine set (convenient to throw our soaking clothes into from the daily rainstorms). The view was fabulous from our balcony and we were treated to giraffe mating season right outside our room. Kids got a huge kick out of and so did we answering many questions. Because of this type of room we had one of the local grocery stores deliver drinks and breakfast foods to our room the day of our arrival. Not only was it affordable but convenient to not have to eat out for breakfast everyday. Also ordered a case of water which I recommend if traveling in the summer as it is HOT! I also advise the meal plan. The one that had a counter meal a snack and a sit down dinner was perfect for us. We knew which parks we would be visiting on a daily basis and we scheduled dinner at a restaurant at that park in advance. (This is a MUST! When they say call 180 days in advance for reservations, it means just that!) This timeframe has been known to change so please check on it. We had no problem getting into the best restaurants every night we wanted, and we ended up way ahead on the meal plan as I totaled what we spent vs. what we paid at the end of each day and you do come out better IF you eat at the nicer more expensive restaurants either on property or at the parks. We ate at Le Cellier, Coral Reef, Boma, Saana, 50's Diner, and Crystal Palace (disappointing buffet) for dinner and lunch at each park. Saana, Coral Reef and Le Cellier were our favorite. Our waitress at 50's diner was a hoot. Just know that reservations are a must and those that stay at the resort and purchase the package get preference on reservations. Negatives: Room Service trays were not picked up all day in the hallway on several occasions. Our room was not vacuumed when we arrived (hair ball on floor) but that was quickly taken care of. Because we stayed in a room typically reserved for DVC members we did not get towel service on the second day (typically if you are a DVC member your towel service is every few days). When I called and reminded them I was not a DVC member and that I would like fresh towels daily we had them. Property is the farthest away from the Magic Kingdom but sometimes the decompressing ride back on the bus was just what our kids aged 13 and 9 needed to unwind. We went in August and there was a thunder/lightning storm almost every afternoon and they would close the pool due to weather conditions - not Disney's fault but that was when we wanted to swim the most was early evening and sure enough it was pouring and lightning. Make sure to bring your ponchos! Also, be sure to ask when Disney checks your bags at the hotel (service offered free as part of our package) that the flight has not been canceled or delayed. Our first flight was delayed causing our luggage to be checked all the way home and we had no control in changing it once we arrived at the airport and found we had automatically been rerouted on another flight. We made it home fine......3 out of 4 bags didn't until a day later. Pros: We never waited more than 15-20 minutes for a bus. If you have ever parked at a disney park you know that the bus service is worth its weight in gold. Our boys loved the map to search and find every animal at the Jambo House and even went out at night with the night goggles they provide to look for the animals. The pool at the Kidani Village is better and I would recommend taking the quick 5 minute bus trip up the road to the sister property to use that pool. However the bartenders at the pool bar at Jambo House were very friendly and accommodating - great drinks by the way! They also have a gaming room for the kids up at Kidani Village as well however the lobby is 1/10th the size it is at the Jambo House and way less impressive. Ladies were in the lobby daily giving facts and information about Africa and its history and the kids enjoyed asking questions and getting answers in the lobby daily on our way out for the day.

The staff at both facilities were very friendly and helpful. Both facilities were very clean and up to Disney standards. The design of the Jambo House lobby is extraordinary, very very impressive much more so than the Kidhani Village lobby. Kidhani only offers one restaurant which is somewhat formal. Most of the villas at Kidhani have full kitchens since it is part of Disney's Vacation Club. Jambo House offers a few different restaurants including one which is cafeteria style and very casual. We found that the food was good but rather pricey. The pools at both facilties are very nice and heated. The pool at Jambo House is beautifully landscaped with a nice waterslide. The pool at Kidhani has a longer waterslide than Jambo. Jambo House has a good size retail store, but the store at Kidhani is rather limited. Both facilities have 2 savannahs. We had a room at Kidhani which overlooked the larger of the two savannahs and it had something like 5 or 6 types of animals including zebras, giraffes, antelopes, osteriches, and a type of cattle. We also saw vultures in the savannah. The animals were out in the savannah much of the day and slept out in the savannah at night. We all loved our savannah view and would highly recommend booking a room with this view. Overall, it was an excellent experience and would not hesitiate to return to either the Kidhani Village or the Jambo House Resort at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The one downside of staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge is that it seems to be located much further from most of the Disney Parks as compared to many of the other Disney Resorts, so expect longer bus rides to most of the Disney Parks except the Animal Kingdom Park.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Castle, IN", "Title": "\u201cUnique Experience for a Disney Resort\u201d", "Author": "LeLacAppelle", "ReviewID": "UR56661498", "Content": "Our family stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge in the main building over Christmas.

The room was very clean, but there was not a lot of room to spare. We were a bit disappointed with our view of the savannah - we were up closer to the lobby and had a less open view. We found that with the cool weather of December that the animals were out and visible more during the afternoon - a time when we were at the parks and not in the room. We did enjoy the views from other points in the hotel that are open to all who stay there. We did spend the majority of our time in the theme parks. The weather was too cool to utilize the pool, but it did look very inviting. Our children did participate in a unique ornament making and the staff truly seemed to enjoy helping our kids be creative. If you or your children are picky about different/unusual foods, you may want to make sure to make dining plans elsewhere. We did enjoy the unusual flavors at Jiko (fine dining) and even in the Mara (counter service). They do have a few usual standards. AK Lodge is a beautiful hotel and the service was very good.

Disney has done a wonderful job with this facility. The kids and I are animal lovers and were blown away at being yards away from all of these exotic animals and birds in a sudo-natural environment. We happened to travel during the COLDEST WEEK IN HISTORY, so most of our time was spent admiring the animals from inside the room but the animals were troopers and roamed all around for equal visibility. The Disney \"experience\" starts as soon as you hit the check in desk. The staff asked if we were celebrating anything and when we responded a birthday, she pulled out a button that said \"Happy Birthday\" and wrote my son's name on it. For the next 4 days 75% of every Disney employee we came across wished him Happy Birthday and he LOVED every minute. LOTS of things for young children to do at the hotel including daily arts and crafts, games, a game room and a kids club (babysitting service) located in a room with as many toys as your local target. My son was in tears while we were at Magic Kingdom (yes, we were AT Magic Kingdom) because he was ready to leave the park and go play at the kids club back at AKL. Wish we had more time to enjoy the facilities at the hotel especially the Agave Margaritas....yummmm. Highly recommend signing up for the dining plan while making your reservations. The food was very satisfying and tasty, however, pricing can leave you with sticker shock. Then again, it is Disney soooooo inflated prices is kinda to be expected. Really enjoyed the buffet and being able to sample all of the ethnic foods but think that $30 for anyone 10 and older is a bit much. Only ate there once during the trip. Was very pleased to see a wide selection of beer and wine at the Mara!!! And after a day at a theme park with the kids, I didn't care how much that bottle of wine cost :-) Mara had a decent offering for breakfast, lunch and dinner that was satisfying for everyone in the family. Didn't go all the way to Florida for chicken nuggets & burgers, but that's what it took to keep the kids quiet so.... so be it. We traveled with the kids, but wouldn't mind going back just Hubby and I. Just need to adjust your expectations about a 'mature' experience because the reality is that it is a family resort so the kids do kinda run the show. Only disappointing experience is with Lost & Found. Ended up leaving something in the room and have left two messages with Lost & Found but have not received a return phone call :-( If the tickets to the theme park don't break the budget, spend a few extra dollars to stay at AKL but most importantly, plan to spend some time and enjoy all the benefits the hotel has to offer", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cI agree about the pool\u201d", "Author": "mmsanfca", "ReviewID": "UR56385189", "Content": "Well, it sounds like the pool is still having it's problems.

Every year Walt Disney world near Orlando Florida holds the Disney Marathon. My partner was a finisher in this spectacular event on January 10. We stayed in the Animal Kingdom lodge: Jambo House, with savanna view room overlooking the exotic animals that roamed the African grassland surrounding the hotel. There was a variety of species which contentedly went about their daily routines with little regard to the hotel and guests a few meters away. It was a treat to wake up to this idyllic scene and watch the sun rise in the morning. The room was adequately spacious and had 2 large queen beds, a small table and chair set, a nice balcony, large screen LCD television with an external port replicator making device connection easier. Ours however was not connected and required some minor maintenance to re-enable. The bathroom was in two rooms with the shower and toilet in one and the vanity and two sinks in the other. Fortunately the room also had a furnace, due to the extreme cold weather, it came in quite handy. The resort was in great condition, very well maintained and had two restaurants. The pool was under maintenance but we had access to the Kidani lodge pool a few minutes away. It was too cold to swim so the pool was not an issue. The menu plan we chose included one full service and one fast food meal with snacks daily. I would recommend buying one of the menu plans which saved us many hundreds of dollars. Without it, food can be very expensive and there are very few places to eat that are not Disney affiliated restaurants. The two menu restaurants at the lodge are Boma and Jiko. Boma, is an \u201corder from the menu\u201d, or \u201cself serve\u201d buffet. Its African inspired cuisine was quite good although the flavour bases were somewhat repetitive with cinnamon, curry and chipotle predominating. Roast beef and spare ribs were featured daily. Varieties of soups and salads and other food choices were available and changed on a daily basis. Parties of six or more are automatically charged an 18% gratuity, Parties of 5 and under were not. Alcohol based drinks are not included in meal plans and they can be pricey. Soft drinks etc. are usually included. Jiko, a 5 star restaurant with a full menu of meat and fish was excellent and the service was very good. Two food menu credits per person are required if using the meal plan at Jiko. The bread and cheese selections were particularly good, with different African breads and both cow and goat cheeses available. The Sanaa restaurant at Kidani village is very good and offers African influenced dining along the same lines as Boma and Jiko. Mara at Jambo house is a quick service based outlet offering traditional American fast food cuisine with a static menu and interchangeable options. Casey\u2019s which offered baseball themed fare at Magic Kingdom was a particularly good choice for a quick service meal, the ballpark franks (hotdogs) were very tasty and the food plan can be used at almost all the food outlets and restaurants. Food plans can also be used at some of the non Disney restaurants. All were clearly marked regarding food plan inclusion or non inclusion. Guides for everything can be picked up at the resorts or anywhere in the Disney parks. Park passes are required if using the food plan option. Passes may be purchased anywhere but are cheaper and more convenient if included in your vacation package. A park hopper pass allows you to bounce from one park to the other at any time. Without it parks can only be visited on one day with unlimited access. Book your food reservations as soon as possible to avoid eating at odd times or late in the evening as the traditional meal times are booked first and quickly. The best most efficient way to travel anywhere in the Disney parks is by the Disney transit system which is very efficient and goes everywhere, a bus comes approx. every 15-20 minutes.

Fact: When we booked our trip, we could have booked a better room at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando for less per night than the standard room we booked at the AKL. So, assuming you know that the Disney properties aren't a great value, read on... This is a nice property -- the atrium is gorgeous. We got upgraded from a standard room to a room overlooking one of the savannahs, and we were across the hall from an overlook above the savannah on the other side of the hotel, which made viewing animals pretty easy. But after a couple of days, my wife and I were in the mindset of, \"oh, cool...there's a giraffe again.\" My son lost his interest in the zebras, giraffes and other critters after a couple days as well and started asking where the rhinos were. There are no rhinos, so we dealt with that the best we could. :) The room was comfortable, but a little smallish. It needed a comfortable sitting chair and didn't have one. Bedding was plush. Lots of Disney details throughout the room. TV options were HORRIBLE (#1, be prepared for 10 ABC channels and 5 ESPN channels and not much else; #2, our remote worked about half the time and there were no buttons on the TV to manually change channels). Most of the staff we interacted with was terrific -- housekeeping staff was especially friendly, as were the folks posted outside who provided information about the animals. Here's the biggest issue: This is a big resort. The last thing you want to do after a long day at the parks is spend another 7-8 minutes walking from the lobby to your room. You must enter through the lobby and then schlep yourself to your room -- in our case this was a solid 7-8 minute walk. Everything is a good walk away (and we were in a fairly central room -- there were rooms that were farther away from things). On the day of our checkout, there was a system-wide computer failure which made for an inconvenient checkout (computers still weren't up when we left.)

I had used my debit card & this second charge had eaten up my entire cash reserve in my bank account. the charge was easily visible on my bank account but didnt show up in the AKL \"system\". Since it didnt show up in their system they refused to help. Even though i showed them my account online where the double charge was plainly visible, 2 front desk people refused to help even though i was at the front desk crying saying that since it was sunday i had no cash & couldnt talk to the bank until Monday. Even the manager said that all i could do was to talk to their financial services dept. Financial services said my only resource was to wait until Monday & have my bank call them. so, Monday my bank manager did a conference call between myself & WDW financial services. even after my bank manager explained how they had double charged me & how it was clearly their mistake, they still REFUSED to help me. My bank manager reversed the charge herself so that i would have my money back. it was a nightmare. however, i have been to WDW 15 times & this was the only experience i have ever had that even comes close to negative. the lesson is never use your debit card at a hotel. ever. so back to this trip. my boyfriend didnt have any idea what the hotel looked like (i am the planner), he couldnt believe how beautiful & \"not disney\" it looked. he just couldnt say enough how much he loved our hotel. i love the AKL most for the same reason that a lot of people compain about: the \"darkness\". i dont consider it dark, i think its beautiful, sophisticated & mature. its everything i want as an adult, without kids, traveling to WDW. also, we were super lucky that when we arrived at 7am from an overnight flight, they had a room ready for us. it was fantastic. i had called a couple days before arrival & had them note that we would be coming in early & if possible to check in early, but there was no guarantee. we totally lucked out. The room they gave us was \"standard\" view, but we lucked out again, because we were on the ground floor & right across our balcony was a savannah. we had a perfect view of giraffes ever day! also, we had purchased park tickets separately, and the front desk was nice enough to attach them to our room keys. everyone was so nice. the other main reason i like AKL so much is the food. i think they have the best selection of non fast food type food. i am a vegetarian & my boyfriend isnt really a cheeseburger guy & the AKL has great food. actually, i should say MARA has great food, because we dont do the restaurants ( i dont like making reservations so far in advance). They also serve my boyfriends favorite beer, Casa from Morocco, which didnt hurt either. Regarding the bus rides: unless you stay at a monorail hotel, you are going to wait for a bus. so plan accordingly. we barely ever waited more than 5 minutes for our bus to arrive, and this was during the off season. and yes, some places are further away than others on the bus, but you wouldnt get there any faster in your own car. (and if you are like me & my boyfriend, you love to go to Epcot & drink & have a sober bus driver take you home). the buses dont bother me, but thats just me. i'm on vacation, i'm not in a hurry. over all, i think this hotel is beautiful & everything great about Disney while still being adult, romantic, mature & comfortable. the rooms arent huge or fancy, but at WDW whos spending that much time in your room anyways? i would recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially people who want Disney, but dont want \"Disney\".", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cStay Here!\u201d", "Author": "mom3boysNj", "ReviewID": "UR55510344", "Content": "Loved this hotel... it is very unique.

However,.....that's about all you get from it - because it is very poorly run. The staff are very helpful and friendly and try hard - but this still doesn't hide the fact that little works as it should: a true African experience, you might say. The building is everything, the rest is below-par. Like the other posts below, housekeeping isn't quite on the ball and it took 7 consecutive visits by amiable, smiling staff just to get 2 teabags (which should have been there anyway). By the 4th tap on the door, I was wishing I hadn't asked! The deluxe rooms are a bit cramped - and quite frankly the views of the savannah are a bit irrelevant if you have just visited Animal Kingdom where you see many more of the same animals right up close, should you take the Kilimanjaro Safari ride. The views of animals from your balcony are usually at some distance and after the first 5 minutes, you probably couldn't care less. Even my 8-year old had no interest and she loves animals. You can't get a table for breakfast or dinner unless you book well in advance: the desk staff say this is because it's such a huge hotel (which it is) and also it's a popular dining venue - which is cold comfort when it's 8am or pm and you're starving. Forget about dining in Jiko unless you reserved last week - and when you do get a table let's hope you are more impressed than we were. Good, yes. Special, no. More of an up-market canteen, really. The acid-test of how poorly-organised this place is manifests itself at the front-desk. Trying to get someone to talk to you is a fight of the fittest - and you have to be patient, very. The poor staff are visibly harassed and hiding from people because everything is a direct or veiled complaint - just spend a few minutes listening if you have the misfortune to stay there. I loved the decor and the cathedral-like atmosphere of the lobby but who wants to stay in a cathedral? For somewhere so beautiful, it really is quite soulless. We stayed for our first week in a budget hotel before moving to the AKL where one night cost more than the week in the previous hotel. How I wish we hadn't moved! The first hotel was better all-round and near I-Drive instead of in the middle of nowhere.

We'd booked a standard view room but were kindly upgraded upon arrival to a Savannah view, room #3452. The good: This resort has incredible decor. Lots of art and artifacts, with plaques telling the story or describing what you're seeing. Many of the Cast Members are from Africa, in an exchange program Disney has set up with African Tourism and Animal preserve organizations. The Cast Members are very knowledgeable about the animals on the property, and the art and decor in the lodge, and are happy to tell you about their life in Africa. While waiting for the bus to the parks in the morning, there were often Cast Members out there with animal parts (teeth, antlers, etc) and educational games for the children. The gift shop, Zawadi marketplace, was immense, and had a generous selection of gifts as well as food and toiletry items. The not so good: The room was a lot smaller than we anticipated for a Deluxe resort. We were glad to have 2 queen beds (instead of doubles, which are too small for us), but there was a tiny table with only 2 chairs, so the four of us could never all sit down together. Mousekeeping had done a quick job preparing the room -- we found gummy candy on the carpet and the exterior of the fridge was covered with sticky hand prints. Also one sink did not drain (the plug was stuck in the down position), the clock and phone were covered with sticky residue, and the i-home clock was set 10 minutes too fast, and we couldn't figure out how to reset it without instructions. We enjoyed seeing a few animals from our balcony, but were disappointed that there wasn't a quidebook or pamphlet to tell us what we were seeing. When we asked for one, we were told they weren't available anymore. We also had to ask to receive a tip sheet with the daily activities for the resort -- we were not given one when we checked in, and there was not one in the room, so we had no idea about all the activities until our visit was almost over. The pool was closed, and the \"shuttle\" to Kidani village was actually just using regular bus transportation, so the one time we made the trek to go swimming, we ended up walking 10 minutes instead of waiting 20 minutes for a bus. We were told there would be a shuttle, which we assumed would be a van or mini bus between the two. The quick service restaurant is downstairs, in the basement, so refilling those resort mugs can take a long walk. Often we'd go get a drink to take back to our room, and by the time we actually got back to the room the cup was empty! There should be \"refill stations\" in other parts of the hotel, like at the ends of each wing! The soundproofing between rooms is very minimal. We could clearly hear the family in the next room each night as they struggled to get their kids to sleep, one night as late as 2:00am! We also could hear the plumbing noise of toilets flushing and showers running in the rooms above, below, and beside us. Not what you'd expect from a \"Deluxe\" resort. Overall: We enjoyed or stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge/Jambo House, but didn't really have time (or the information sheet until the 2nd to last day) to partake of all the activities it offered. It was a one-time splurge, and we won't likely stay there again. I'd recommend this hotel if you love Africa and observing wild animals. Also if you are up for the walking (the place is really spread out) and stairs/elevators (restaurants on basement level). I would NOT recommend this hotel if you have small children.

So, after much review, we decided to take the Disney route. I finally decided on the Animal Kingdom Lodge because of the pictures of the swimming pool, Disney's transportation and the ability to watch animals from your room. Our trip was good, but it would have been great if only Disney would have disclosed a few items, and would pay a little closer attention to details. Let me explain... We arrived at 2:30 for a 3pm check-in. We knew that we were early and that we would probably have to wait for a little while and we were advised that we would have a room by 3:30pm. What we didn't realize, was that we wouldn't be actually given a room until after 5:30. I would not have minded the delay, if they would simply advise you of the timeframe, so that you don't find yourself sitting in the lobby with your luggage for 3 hours like we did. After we finally made it to the room, we decided to take the kids to the pool, only to find that it is closed for refurbishement. This would have been really nice to know before we booked our package. They do offer shuttle service to the next villas to use their pool, but who wants to get on a bus and ride to another facility to use their pool while on vacation? Our room was nice and well appointed with great views of the animal areas, but it was a tremendous effort to just to reach it. I actually counted from the lobby, and it was 357 steps to the room. I'm really not sure of how this is equivileant in mileage, but it was definitely a long way, and I am a 10 mile a week runner. My advice on the transportation system to the park is to not use it. It is much easier to drive and parking is free as long as you are a guest at any of their resorts.

We were on the dining plan and ate at Boma and Mara several times. The Boma buffet at breakfast and dinner includes choices for both picky and adventurous eaters. The quality of the food is outstanding. The value at Mara for breakfast is especially good - a couple can easily share one of the combo platters. The lobby of the lodge is breathtaking. The shop has all of the souvenirs and convenience items that one expects in addition to a wonderful selection of African wares. Our king bed room with daybed, though not extremely spacious, was immaculate. Having a refrigerator came in handy for leftovers and snacks. All in all I would heartily recommend a stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge!", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cKidani Village\u201d", "Author": "Luka1925", "ReviewID": "UR53621188", "Content": "My wife, four year old son and I stayed recently @ kidani village.

We brought our 10 month old son for his first vacation. I was nervous about planning a trip with an infant & didn't want to have to worry about little details. If you have any questions, I would encourage calling the 1-800 number on Disney's website. Their customer service people are very helpful & can answer minor or major questions/concerns you might have. Because of needing a large amount of supplies for an infant (i.e. diapers, snackcups, bottles, baby spoons, snacks, babyfood, etc.) I shipped a package to myself at the hotel. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this if you have a child OR just if you have too much to take in your suitcase! Its very simple to do if you are staying on Disney Property. You simply ship the box to yourself...with your name, Disney reservation number, & hotel address on it. Ship it so it arrives no earlier than 2-3 days prior to your visit. This process is wonderful! The disney cast member will link the box to your reservation in their computer system...so whenever you arrive, you don't even have to ask about your box! They will retrieve your reservation & get your box immediately! It was so convenient! As I said, this is good even if you don't have kids...simply mail yourself clothing, shoes, whatever won't fit in your suitcase! You can ship yourself a Large Flat Rate box for around $13.95 (up to 70 pounds) and this is much cheaper than the cost for an extra suitcase with the airlines! (just an extra tip!) Upon arrival, they also gave us a button that said \"First Visit\" for my son. He was a little young, but still loved the fact that he was given something while the cast member spoke to us about our room. The check-in process was very quick (I also recommend check-in on the Disney website if you book through Disney...you can do it the day before you leave & it makes the process much quicker/smoother!) Before saying anything about our room, I must comment on the huge lobby...it was beautiful!!! It is decorated with an African culture theme & has huge windows to see outside. Its absolutely beautiful! There is a gift shop onsite with Disney items (like stuffed animals, keychains, mugs/glasses, photoalbums, shirts, etc) as well as Animal Kingdom items & African culture items. Its a very nice store with a wide variety of items. In addition, I was surprised at the large variety of \"convenience store\" items you could get. One evening, we needed a bunch of things & I was planning to run to the giftshop...I made the comment to my husband \"If they have it.\" I didn't think they would have the items I needed...I was afraid I'd have to run to Walmart or Target. Well they had everything I was looking for. They have toothpaste, shampoo, pretzels/chips, some first aid items, a freezer with icecream...just to give you some examples. Over the course of my trip, I spent close to $250 at the giftshop at the Lodge & I watch money carefully (I am not a spender!) The rooms are very spacious. I don't know why others have complained about room space. Keep in mind, I had an infant who was crawling & starting to walk...he needed lots of space. I had no complaints...there was a closet with enough room to hang all of our stuff. I didn't have enough hangers though for all 3 of us but we just put our extra tops in the drawers. I had more than enough space in the 2 large drawers in the armoire...one for our clothes & one for my son's diapers, shoes, & toys/books that we brought along. We had a King-size bed, a couch, a small refrigerator, coffee maker, a small table with 2 chairs, and a private balcony. The vanity area has double sinks & the bathroom is separate from this area...I liked this a lot, it made getting ready in the morning a lot easier. The shower was huge & the bathroom had a door for privacy. I would suggest upgrading your room to the \"savana view\" so that you are able to watch the animals. Its not a necessity but it makes your trip a lot more enjoyable! My son & I spent many mornings & evenings on the balcony watching the animals. (hint: the animals are out more in the morning than evening...I think it is easier to see the animals from the viewing areas in the evenings) If you are planning to spend 10+ hours in the parks, I wouldn't suggest the \"savana view\" because you could spend that extra money on food, souvenirs, or another park ticket! There are many areas throughout the resort where you are able to sit in wooden rocking chairs & watch the animals. There are cast members (most from Africa) who are extremely knowledgeable & can tell you tons of information about the animals & culture! This was a great part of the trip! There is also a large viewing area outdoors, a playground, weightroom, arcade, and pool. Unfortunately because of my son's age, we weren't able to use the weightroom, arcade, or pool as much as we would've liked. The pool does have a nice wading area for small babies/toddlers. I took my son there one evening & he enjoyed it (it was the 2nd time he was in a pool) and I noticed the kids & how much fun they were having. So, even if you have very young kids, they will still be able to enjoy the pool area! One tip -- don't bring towels to the pool. There are areas (they look like large garbage cans) that have towels for you to use at the pool & an area to put them in when you are done. Very convenient! The eating areas -- AKL has 3 of these. Two are restaurants (I believe the one only serves dinner) -- they are the Boma & the Jiko. Unfortunately we did not go to either because you had to have reservations ahead of time. The one night, we went down & asked how long the wait would be & they said 45 minutes to 1 hour. It was nice because they give you a \"button\" to take to your room & it will light up & vibrate when they have a table ready for you. Unfortunately, my son fell asleep back in our room & since we didn't want to wake him, we cancelled with the restaurant. I have heard wonderful things about both restaurants & know people from other resorts who HAVE to go to the Boma every visit to Orlando! We primarily ate at the parks or at the Mara (the quick-service restaurant). I feel that they had a large variety of items (burgers, pizza, fried shrimp, soups, etc.) as well as three coolers full of snacks & side items. I would recommend getting the \"Disney souvenir mug\" with unlimited refills...HUGE savings! I believe it costs $14-15 and you will spend this your first day on property. In the coolers, they have different fruits, carrots, cakes, yogurt, tons of options as well as drinks. I would say however that its pricey...if you have a rental car, go to the local Walmart or Super Target & stock your refrigerator with snacks & drinks. They have a large seating area indoors as well as a few tables outdoors. Its nice to sit in the airconditioning after being outside at the parks, but its also nice to sit outdoors & enjoy the plants/scenery. There are stairs & elevators to get around the hotel & to the eating areas. I also recommend if you do not need a rental car, use the Disney Magical Express for yourself & your luggage. It is a simple process...at the airport, you go to a specially designated counter...its huge, you can't miss it! One person goes to the counter while the rest of your party waits on large couches/chairs. You check-in & it takes less than 5 minutes (even with a long line). You then go to another line & immediately get onto a bus which will take you to your hotel. We were the last stop & were there within 30 minutes...I thought it was pretty quick & loved not having to drive through Orlando traffic. You also get to see other resorts along the way. There are tvs on the bus for small children & adults to watch & learn about Disney. The day before you leave, the resort places a note on your door that says when the bus will arrive to pick you up. You simply take your luggage downstairs, check in with a cast member (who takes your luggage), and then head outside to wait for your bus. It takes you directly to the airport & you don't see your luggage again until you arrive at your home airport! Its very convenient & its one less thing you have to worry about. We also used the Disney shuttles to get to the parks. Make sure to ask when you check-in for a bus schedule. The buses arrive every 15-20 minutes (we never had to wait for a bus) but the schedule will tell you how to get around. For example, how to get to Downtown Disney via the bus route. I also highly recommend the Disney Photopass CD especially if you have kids or are traveling in a large group...order it online ahead of time for around $120 (sometimes they have a special for $99). This sounds expensive, but if you wait until you get home, you will pay $14.95 just for one picture or to get the download of ONE picture. We didn't even use the Photopass photographers that much & had over 50 photos. This is how it works: You will get a card (looks like a credit card) with a 16-digit number on it -- this service is free. Throughout the parks & some hotels, photographers will take pics for you. After you get home, you will enter the code on the website & can order whatever pics you'd like (or you can have a cast member do it for you at the resort or a photo center at the park). As I said, if you prepay the $99, you can have a downloaded copy of all the pictures & license to use them/enlarge them/whatever you want to do with them. You also can go on Disney's website & find locations of where the Photopass photographers are located throughout each park. They also come to the character meals. If you have a very young child & don't ride much, you may not see as many Disney characters because a lot of them are at the end of the rides. Ask any cast member & they can tell you where to get a \"Character Greeting Times Guide\"...this changes day-to-day & at each park. You can pick one up at the Magic Kingdom at either City Hall (in Town Square) or at the main tip board on Main St USA. I'm not sure where the guides are at other parks (probably near the entrances...ask a cast member). I also advise reserving meals ahead of time that are a MUST to your trip, especially Character Dining. You can do it on the Disney website or through their customer service number. I apologize for the length of this review...but I wanted to make sure to get all of my information in! I came home & said \"Oh, I wish someone would have told me that before I went\" at least a million times! So I didn't want to leave anything out. My main advice...if you don't know something, ask a Cast Member. They are all knowledgeable & can assist with any question you might have. If they don't know, they will find out...very nice people at all resorts & parks!", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Pleasant\u201d", "Author": "InTheBizMyself", "ReviewID": "UR53412966", "Content": "We took mom for a milestone birthday to Kidani Village.

Ate breakfast downstairs in the quick service each morning. Ate dinner one evening quick service and also used our refill mugs for cocoa or cola. We have stayed the All Star Resorts and Pop Century.

Here is my review of the hotel with some thoughts about the Disney experience as a whole. The Hotel is indeed beautiful. it\u2019s a massive, African themed structure packed with eye-pleasing wood carvings, moldings , and lavish displays of every kind. It\u2019s Disney, and definitely does not disappoint. The rooms are also decorated in the same substantial wood decor. The balconies are a little small, but the views of the savannas and grounds are very pleasurable. I was a little naive expecting to see animals all the time, but for the most part there weren\u2019t many animals walking around. But when they were there, it was awesome! Especially the giraffes, but again they were only around for about 10 minutes a day. To be fair, we only had a few hrs of viewing time in the mornings as we were gone by 9 or 10 and didn\u2019t return till after dark. We were on the 3rd floor Kudo trail. And you can smell the poop at times. We dined at Boma, the buffet several times for dinner and twice for breakfast. I loved the variety of foods, and sampled everything. There were also plenty of kid friendly foods, French fries, pasta, along with chicken, beef and pork. The one thing I didn\u2019t like was the 18% gratuity extracted as the wait staff weren\u2019t that visible and basically just refilled sodas. If there was one thing I regretted about the trip is that I didn\u2019t catch on to was the reservation concept. I thought that only character breakfasts needed reservations, fortunately I was able to get last minute reservations ( two weeks prior to arrival) at some nice places, Trails End at Wilderness lodge being one of them.

We debated staying down at the port but one of the families we were with wanted to stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge. Checking Disney's website showed a basic, non-view room would be $300/night. However, Expedia had the same room for $170/night. We booked and had low expectations- room near an elevator with a view of the parking lot. Our expectations were set too low. We had a quiet room down a hallway with a view of the animal area. It was great. Giraffes, zebras and antelope-like animals would wander near our room. They weren't 10 feet away, but sitting on the balcony gave a great view while the animals walked around and ate. The room itself was nice. We have previously stayed at Disney's cheaper resorts- Caribbean Beach and Coronado Springs. Those places were a little run down, with squeaky beds, old TVs, etc. Animal Kingdom Lodge has nice beds, flat screen TVs, nice fixtures in the bathroom, etc. The hotel premises are great. There are a bunch of animal viewing areas where you can sit and watch the animals running around. There are two big pools, each with a waterslide, and one with a water park (water cannons, a waterfall, a water playground). Disney staff were doing games and activities for the kids (free) at the bigger pool. There are at least three restaurants on site, including one that has quick service (with made to order plus pre-packaged food for sale). I do wish they would improve a few things: -WiFi should be free in all rooms. Instead, they have a wired connection available for $10/day. -Channel selection on the TV is pretty weak. -Food quality was a little sub-par. Not terrible, but could be improved. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It is more expensive than the cheaper places, but if your kids like pools and the weather is nice, you can skip the parks for a day or two and just hang out at the hotel (free), go to Downtown Disney (free), and go to The Boardwalk (free). The money you save just might make up the difference, and the rooms are substantially nicer than the cheaper places on the property.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge !\u201d", "Author": "manzoorf", "ReviewID": "UR50628354", "Content": "What a wonderful experience at the AKL. Starting with our Magical Express bus trip from Orlando Airport and the smooth and relaxing 35 min trip to the hotel, this was exceptional service at its best. The lobby itself is something to behold ... very impressive yet warm and inviting. Having arrived a bit earlier than the 3PM check-in time, we were pleasantly surprised to have a room available for us immediately. It gave us a chance to freshen up before heading out to Epcot. Being a stickler for room and hotel cleanliness, we were struck by the upkeep and cleanliness of our hotel room, bathroom, the hotel lobby and general access areas. Our room had two queen beds and a pool view. Very comfortable beds and pillows and the flat screen TV and balcony seating was great. Even though we didn't have a Savannah view room, viewing Giraffes, zebras and other animals from the various animal vantage points across the hotel was easy and fun. I know some people have commented about waiting times for the shuttles to the parks but we never waited more than 15 minutes and the ride was quick and direct to every park. From what I understand, the AKL is one of the few Disney properties that have direct shuttles to every single park. The only gripe we have about shuttles was that after park closing times, there was not always a shuttle readily available to hop back onto and usually the shuttles were standing room only and we had a stop at the Kidani Village lodge on the way back. However, again the wait was no more than 20-25 minutes every night. Boma : We had the breakfast buffet at Boma one morning and while it was very expensive (almost $70/2 adults + a 6 yr old), the choices were varied and exceptional. I especially enjoyed the corned beef with the Boma mustard. My wife was a big fan of the \"omlette your way\" option and the goat cheese scrambled eggs. We did breakfast at the Quick service Mara most other mornings and while not exceptional, the breakfast was not bad (and comparitively cheaper). Jiko : Between the superb soups and appetizers and the exceptional dinner entrees (tuna and curried prawns were superb), I can see why its such a highly regarded restaurant. It was an expensive indulgence that was well worth it. Simba's Clubhouse : We had the kids stay at Simba's Clubhouse the night we went to Jiko restaurant. The kids loved the Clubhouse and had lots of choices of activities - coloring, reading, movies and playstations that kept them busy and happy. Plus we were able to order the kids dinner at the Clubhouse. The rate was reasonable at 35/hr for 3 kids (ages 5,6 and 8). The Mara : Great location for snacks and quick meals. Open till 11:30 PM which made it convenient for quick snack runs after we returned back from park closures. Zawadi Market : Great selection of Disney branded items. Prices were comparable to about what one should expect for gifts/items in the parks. Our return back to the airport on the Magical Express was yet another smooth affair. In all, kudos to Disney for a job very well done with the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Some of our friends who visited the hotel and had stayed at other Disney Resorts in Orlando were very impressed with the overall ambience of the hotel.

However this review is for those who tend to stay at upscale resorts when traveling. We booked a standard room with the Savannah view (facing the animals) and I\u2019m not sure it was worth the extra money. We didn\u2019t spend much time in our room, let alone on the balcony and there are quite literally dozens of opportunities to see the very same animals on your walk to the lobby and as you walk the grounds of the resort. If you plan on spending time in your room during the day or have children who might spend time on the balcony, I would absolutely suggest the Savannah view. If you plan on being out of the room during the daylight hours, I would suggest you save the money and get a garden view. The dining options at AK Jamba house (the main section of the resort) were a bit disappointing. The newest restaurant, Jiku, bills itself as an upscale South African dining experience however they aren\u2019t quite there yet. The wine list was unique, try the Del Toren Fusion V, the food was delicious however the service was lacking in that we had to ask for water and we used the same utensils throughout the meal. For a meal that is comparably priced at Morton\u2019s Steakhouse ($41 for an a la carte filet), I expected the service to be spectacular and it wasn\u2019t. Every restaurant has a bad night; however we spoke with a couple at Epcot who experienced the same thing earlier in the week. We did not eat at the buffet, but there seemed to be many choices of meats, fruits and vegetables. The quick service section, the Mara, was as is to be expected. Fast food, coffee, soda, bagels in the morning. The pizza (cheese flatbread) was excellent believe it or not. A good place for a quick lunch or a snack as you lay by the pool. As I mentioned, there are many opportunities to view the animals that are kept in the resort. Everywhere you look, there are \u201clook out\u201d sections where you can lean up against the rock and watch the giraffes, zebras, antelopes, gazelles\u2026you name it. It was very cool to see. The pool and multiple hot tubs are open 24 hours and they weren\u2019t very busy. All in, the rooms were clean, the staff was friendly and the drinks were cold.

The hotel is as amazing as the pictures look. And I'm not that easily pleased ! The reception/longe area is a fantastic place to chill out on the huge furniture with loads to look at and see. We did not book a special room but we still had animals every day at the rear - giraffes, all sorts. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, the check-in was quick and easy and the hotel room was gorgeous. Yes it can be shady as the wood is dark but it is truly atmospheric. The dual sinks and separate bathroom works well with more than 2 people sharing. The beds were comfy. The TV was huge - mostly US channels but hey, you are in the US and why would you come if all you wanted to see was UK channels ! It's a fair walk (2 minutes !) if you are in a room a way away but no haslle, and good exercise and there are viewing windows and patios and things to look at all the way along. Even drinks/food/ice machines ! We tried all the restaurants - the quick self-service restaurant was excellent - the food for self-service was great and reasonable - coffee $1.25 ? You don't get that in the UK anymore. My fave was the soup that came in a hollowed-out bread roll dish, wonderful. The buffet restaurant, though always busy, was easy to get a table if you didn't mind waiting half an hour or so - go there about 5 and they will give you a pager for when your table is ready even if it's 2 hours later. Its always fully booked months in advance but you will get a table. It was no problem. The food was really good and all-you-can eat for about 30 dollars adult, 15 child. Quite expensive with the \u00a3 not being as strong as it was but worth it. The range was amazing. The fine-dining restaurant is exactly that. So don't go there if you're looking for a quick large portion meal. It's not that, it's all carefully freshly prepared and has wonderful fine ingredients. We paid $200 for 3 of us for 3 courses plus wine and soft drinks but it was top notch. Try the room service also if you can't get a restaurant table - the food is in huge portions but soo worth it !!! The pool area of the hotel is also excellent. Tons of sun beds. Towels provided. Shaded areas for families. Easy access to self-service restaurant, waiter service drinks if you want and there is an outdoor bar too. The water is always warm.

The toilet and bathtub area is very small and dark. I like to read while bathing and that was not possible here. I couldn't imagine having to bathe a couple of kids in there. The only amenities we were given were soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Nothing special or extra. The beds were comfy although I prefer a duvet rather than a sheet covered blanket configuration used here. The linens were very nice and crisp. Also, don't expect wifi in this hotel. Internet access is $9.95 per 24 hours and is wired. A wire is thoughtfully provided since most people would expect wifi and probably not bring a cable with them. Since we were staying in a club level room, we had access to the Kilamanjaro Club accessed with our room key to the sixth floor. An adequate continental breakfast (with the best oatmeal) is provided. Tea is held in the afternoon while wine and cheese plus other snacks are available at 5 pm. Then at about 7 pm cordials and desserts are brought out. There is also soda, beer, juices, espresso, etc. at no charge. Of course, the best thing about this hotel is the animals. Make sure to book a savannah view room. Although the pool view would be fine in any other hotel ,seeing giraffes, zebras and numerous other animals and birds from your balcony is amazing. Also, I have to add this. It can be a very long walk to the lobby area from your room because of the layout of the hotel. If possible, ask for a room closer to the lobby than we had.

The rooms are just as big (and probably a little larger than some of the other deluxe resorts) as any of the other Disney deluxe resorts. The only disadvantage to staying here is that it is not as convenient as the Magic Kingdom or Epcot resorts are. With some of the Magic Kingdom and Epcot resorts you can easily walk to the parks. With the Animal Kingdom Resort you will need to drive or take a Disney-provided bus to any of the parks. Another complaint is that food service shuts down too early. The quick bite cafe closes at midnight and there is no 24 hour room service (only breakfast, lunch and dinner). One other thing to note is that hotel does not have a business center or wireless internet access in the rooms. You have to pay about $10/per day for internet access (wired).

Our room was infested in ants and when we complained at first they made us feel like we were lying. Some one was sent up to change our sheets and bedding. Then the phone rang at 1:00 AM saying that pest control was there and wanted to send them up. All I could say was no thanks, you got to be kidding 1:00AM. The next morning I called and asked if we could change resorts and Disney came through and moved us to the Polynesian no extra charge. All in all ok place just not for us even with out the ants.

Unfortunately my mum stuggled to find something she would enjoy, but the staff really did go out there way to assist her, they even offered to make a pizza for her. The pool area is very nice, with flamingos around the bottom area (which are quite smelly when you get close up but they look nice!). The hot tub is extremley hot!

We felt that the room was very well appointed and particularly liked the flat screen TV as it allowed more storage space than we have previously enjoyed at WDW. We made use of the fitness centre and can warmly recommend the massage and facial services, the ladies were great.

We have only two reservations about AKL, firstly it can be very dark in places (it was impossible to see into the safe for example) and secondly it is a very child friendly resort so the pool, lobby and restaurants can be rather noisy (and sometimes fractious).

It would also be nice if they extended the hours of the hotel restaurants at least to match the hours of the parks.

We traveled with 4 generations of family...great grandparents, grandparents, parents (my husband and I) and our 3 children, ages 9, 5 and 2. We made our reservations about 6 months ago, and took advantage of the free dining promotion that Disney was offering. We upgraded the dining plan to the deluxe dining plan so that we would always have the option of a sit down meal, which the older folks prefer. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is lovely. We had stayed there once before, with just our immediate family, so we knew that we'd enjoy the surroundings. We had savannah view rooms, which meant that there were zebra and giraffe outside our balcony at times. Not too close, mind you, but it was neat. The other thing that's really neat about the AKL is that there are tons of African museum quality items throughout the resort. So much so, that the resort is actually considered a museum. A nice educational component, I think. The other thing that we really like about AKL is that there are a lot of programs for kids (and adults, actually) most of which are free, and quite educational. The kids learn about culture, conservation, music, etc. from the staff, over 50% of whom are actually from the African continent, which is really cool. Of course, the animals are always around, which is also really cool. The pool is nice, with a zero entry area, which is nice for the little guys. There is one water slide, which is open from about 9am to 8pm, but the pool itself is open 24 hours, which is also a great feature. The hot tub is large and was not crowded. There is a playground, too, and a very small kiddy pool which is about 1 foot deep, although I don't think that i ever saw anyone there. The restaurants are nice, the Boma has nice buffets with a lot of variety, and the Mara is typical Disney quick service dining. We didn't go to Jiko b/c some of us aren't very adventurous eaters, but I've heard that it's wonderful. The room service dining was fine, but quite pricey, and it was nothing amazing. In fact, my very expensive steak was overcooked. Here are my gripes about our stay: We booked over six months in advance, and requested connecting rooms. We had a total of 3 rooms reserved. We ended up with no connection rooms. We were near each other, but across the hall. And, it seemed like the rest of our party that was across the hall always had animals outside of their windows, and we rarely did! Who knows for sure! The other issue is that my 86 year old grandmother was with us, as was my dad, who, due to a recent injury, was in a wheelchair. Our room was about as far away from the lobby of the hotel as we could be. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that it took us 15 minutes to get to our room from ANYWHERE in the hotel. It was frustrating, to say the least. It made our days much longer, and the older folks much more tired. It was unnecessary and disappointing to me, especially since we booked so far in advance, were with folks who were elderly and infirm, and went at an off peak time. There were very short ride times in the park, so there's no way the AKL was anywhere near its capacity. Also, the AKL rooms seem to be a little smaller than the other Disney Deluxe resorts like Wilderness Lodge. The room description notes that there's a daybed in each room, but there wasn't one in any of our rooms, nor do I have any idea where they'd have put it. We had 2 queen beds, a small table with two chairs, and that was tight! Another issue, although one I knew to expect, is that AKL is far away from the other parks, so expect a long bus ride, no matter where you go...that's the trade off for staying in a place with lots of wild animals!! The one good thing is that AKL basically has its own buses...they don't stop at any other resorts! All in all, a great place to stay, lots of great kid programs, but a big lodge...so bring your hiking boots!!", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best Disney has to offer!\u201d", "Author": "grena4", "ReviewID": "UR46303629", "Content": "We have stayed at a number of Disney hotels and this is one of our favorites.

Also, the room safe is not the size of other hotels so don't plan on being able to lock up your laptop. Rooms come with a refrigerator and if you have children who don't want to share a bed, you can request bunks. We stayed on the club level. A bit of a disappointment is that, though you have access to the club lounge via your room key, the actual floor on which this room is located is only for vacation club members. We requested a room close to the main elevator, making it easier to get our snacks. The room we were given, even though Club, wasn't really prepared as such. When we asked, we were given our robes and extra toiletry amenities as well as turn-down service. They have eliminated plastic water bottles when staying at Club. You may want to buy water and keep it in the room's refrigerator. They will give you Perrier water to go if you ask, however the glass bottles that it comes in isn't permitted in all areas (such as the pool.) The food selections include many less familiar dishes with an African flair, but the snacks and appetizers also include mainstays to keep everyone happy. My one complaint with Disney is that there is no affordable option for Internet access. With the rates we are paying for rooms, that would be a nice touch. Be aware that each guest is allowed about 20 minutes per day Internet access in the Business Center at no charge. We didn't discover that tidbit until our trip was almost over.

I prefer the pool view- the lush trees and tropical feel is more my idea of rest and relaxation. The pool is warm and clean. It is expansive in size- and doesnt reach over 5 feet high in depth. There is a child friendly slide and and two lush encircled spa tubs to bubble up in after a great meal at Boma restaurant.

Yes Free things to make and play- yeah... there is a babysitting club with a room stocked with kiddie activities. I think the fee was 11$ an hr. or so. Real nice.

We had booked a standard room as we couldn't justify the extra cost of a savannah view (\u00a3700) and hoped to be upgraded anyway. When we got there we were given exactly what we paid for - a car park view room! There are other areas to view the animal but to be honest we only went a couple of times so feel better that we didn't pay the extra for a savannah view. The advantage of a standard view is that it was closer to the front of the hotel and therefore the car park, lobby, bus stops etc. I'd never stayed at a deluxe Disney hotel before and assumed the deluxe tag was for the savannah, however the hotel was fab. The beds were extremely comfortable (although this is always subjective) if a little high. I'd read reviews that said the rooms were small and dark but I didn't find that at all. With all the lights on or the curtains open they were very bright and although not large there was enough space. The counter service restaurant The Mara was average but we ate at Boma a couple of times and it was lovely. The pool area was beautiful and the pool itself lovely and warm. The only negatives - housekeeping tended to come late, one day at 4.20pm when we had returned to get changed for dinner which was inconvenient. Not a problem if you stay out all day. The other negative was the car park. Because of the savannahs it's all at the front of the hotel which means you can be parked miles away.

It's very cozy, and there are plenty of nice spots to just sit and relax. Upon reaching the check-in desk, we were immediately greeted with a warm welcome and a smile. I had reserved a standard room on Expedia with a very good rate I might add, so I wasn't expecting any special treatment. To my surprise, we were given a Savanah room with a view of the animals, so I was very happy. There is something about waking up and looking out over the balcony to see giraffes that I thought was pretty cool. I really did enjoy it. As far as the room itself goes, it was beautiful. I thought the size was above average, and did not seem small at all. The room was well decorated, and continued the theming from the lobby and the rest of the hotel. Our housekeeper was also very friendly. Every morning she said hello to us, and on our last day she said goodbye and told us that she hoped to see us again really soon. It seemed sincere and it left a good parting impression on us. The food at the hotel is very good. We ate at Boma one morning for breakfast and it was excellent. The guick service eatery Mara is also very good, we ate there several times. I cannot comment on the dinner buffet at Boma because it was booked solid with reservations when we tried to eat there one night. I want to add that the location of the hotel is not bad at all. Indeed, it is located at the far southwest side of Disney property, but it was not a problem at all. We never waited longer than ten minutes for any bus to arrive, and the farthest ride was to Magic Kingdom, which took 10-15 minutes tops. Honestly, the location is fine, so if anyone is hesitant about staying there for that one reason, DON'T BE!!! The Animal Kingdom Lodge is far too beautiful and wonderful of a resort to pass up because of its location. All in all, I had a wonderful time staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The grounds are beautiful and the staff really does a great job at taking care of you. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "daisysgrandma", "ReviewID": "UR44243507", "Content": "I read the reviews on Trip Advisor before we went and hoped we would be as delighted with this hotel. WE WERE. We arrived quite late and the first night on our balcony we could see the giraffes, zebras and birds. Wonderful. It isn't the cheapest (nor the most expensive) hotel on Disney but we loved it. Our only complaint is that we wished we had longer than the 5 nights so that we could have stayed in the hotel a bit more! The Disney dining plan was absolutely superb. We met someone who said he would 'be glad to get home 'from chicken and burgers'. Well this wasn't our experience. We used our vouchers for breakfast, and meals at some of the top restaurants and didn't have a complaint at all. The snacks were excellent for bowls of fruit or fresh orance juice. We thoroughly enjoyed Donald's Safari breakfast (who wouldn't with a 5 year old?), dinner at the Coral Reef restaurant (Epcot) and a fabulous meal at Jiko in our hotel. Yes we did trade 2 table service vouchers but it was worth it. I can only hope that anyone who goes has such an enjoyable time as we did. Please look out (from the Arusha Savannah) for the large animal (I think an Anikole Cattle) who has his head on one side. We wondered if he had one horn heavier or shorter than the other but no, he had an ear infection. However, our 5 year old decided he had WONKY HONKERS.

This lodge is a nice property, but our stay wasn't without some bumps. We arrived via Magic Express late on Wednesday evening. Upon approaching the Disney transports at the airport we were directed to go to \"that\" bus. I allowed my family to precede me on to the bus, handed my paperwork to be scanned by the cast member and she said, \"your on the wrong bus.\" I stepped up the three stairs and called the family off. In the mean time, the cast member walked away to see where I needed to be only to step back to us and let us know it was okay to board after all. The driver had four stops total. The Animal Kingdom was last. He said it would take 35 minutes. We arrived 50 minutes later. My kids were wowed upon entering the lodge. We arrived about 10:00 PM. We chose to bring carry on baggage with change of cloths, etc. since we didn't know how long it would take for our bags to arrive. There was no one in front of me at check in, and \"Kat\" was very gracious in welcoming us to the lodge. We had our difficulties thanks to a computer glitch. It was a long enough process for my wife and two kids to walk in the lobby and snap photos, go to the restroom, and walk in the lodge's shops. They came back to find me studying my materials about the dining plan and park hours for our days in the park. Kat had disappeared behind the door behind the check out. She had been gone for no less than 15 minutes trying to fix the problem. When my wife asked what was wrong I told her it was computer related. Apparently the computer was having problems making my wife and my room cards table to be used as charge cards. I asked another cast member to get Kat and she informed me of the problem was not fixed, but my kid\u2019s keys would open the room door. Off they went to drop the baggage. My family returned to find me in the same spot. The cast members at this property work hard and with sincerity. I do believe it was a computer glitch, but it was making for a very long check in process with the four of us very hungry and tired. My son informed me our view was of another buildings roof. I asked for a Magical Upgrade and Kat told me to check back in the morning about 9. Finally the glitch was fixed about 10:45. We hurried to the fast food court anticipating it closing at eleven. Mara is open till 11:30. We made it to our room right at 11 PM. Our luggage had not arrived. I called down to the bellman and learned that they \"say\" to allow 3 hours for the bags to appear. My daughter wears contact lenses and we didn't think about bringing additional cleaning supplies in our carry on bag for her lenses, so she and I head down to the shop. It was about 11:05 and the store closed at 11. I called down at 11:30 and our bags were there. They soon appeared. The following morning everything got better. I asked for the magical upgrade and was granted a beautiful pool room view from the fourth floor. The first room we were in had five drawers available to us in two different chests. The new room only had two drawers as part of a TV Armoire. This property looks just like the Wilderness Lodge. We stayed at the WL over Thanksgiving and when we walked in to the beautiful Animal Kingdom's lobby, we both agreed it was the same dimensions. The rooms are also the same as the Wilderness lodge. The beds are very comfortable. The linens and cleanliness of the room were all at Disney standards. The room could be larger for the four of us and all the \"magical stuff\" we accumulated over 4 days. We loved the pool. It has a zero entry and is positioned to receive most of the day\u2019s sun. The water was warm and the depth was comfortable for most children. The slide was delightful as well. The food at Mara was good enough. The selection is great for a child\u2019s appetite and there is a person taking orders to improve the congestion and ordering process. My son and I did spend time in the arcade. I would guess there was close to 30 games. You could find both new and a few older ones for the mature crowd. Take a credit card or cash to play. There is a game card dispensing machine you need to purchase to play. Some members of Trip Advisor have mentioned the Disney property buses are too slow but we would not consider the time waiting, nor the time getting to parks, to be any longer than any other property. The negatives about my stay in the Animal Kingdom Lodge are few. On our last day we went to the parks, came back in the afternoon to swim and our room had not been clean by 4 PM. While getting ready to go back to the parks for the evening, two cast members knocked and when seeing us there asked if we would like to have housekeeping. I said yes. They said they would come back after 4:30. We came back to our room at 10 PM and the room was still untouched. I called down for clean towels and they brought them in minutes. The other thing was part of the theme of the lodge. As impressive as the details to the lodge are, the drumming music that plays nonstop from any speaker in the lodge or restaurants got real old. I wanted to hear a little different magical music by the end of our stay. My family and I agree after our departure we won\u2019t stay here again. It was nice enough but not as great of a deluxe property as we anticipated. We are huge Disney fans, but this lodge was simply not a good fit.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cDeluxe Disney...Plus Animals!\u201d", "Author": "Hosalito", "ReviewID": "UR42479511", "Content": "My husband and I just stayed at the AKL this past weekend. Here are some observations that may be of use to you. 1) The lodge is located near (surprise!) Animal Kingdom. With that said, the bus rides to other parks/Downtown Disney do take longer than they would from other resorts, but never more than 20 minutes. The lobby is amazing with all of the African theming and the wood, but with that said, it as well as the interior corridors were also very dark, so if anyone in your party has vision issues, you may want to stay somewhere else. 2) We had a savannah view room with 1 queen bed (slept 2 adults just fine) and bunk beds. The room size, in all honesty, was not much different than the rooms at the moderately or value priced hotels. The part of the bathroom where the sinks are was spacious, but the actual area where the toity/shower are located was a TIGHT SQUEEZE and rather dark. Somewhat surprising for a deluxe Disney hotel. Also in the room was a desk, chair, a small balcony with two chairs and a tiny table, chest of drawers (under the flat panel TV), a converter so all you'd have to do is bring your gaming system, a wire (in the closet) for high speed internet access ($10/day), a refrigerator, an iron and ironing board, and a hair dryer. 3) I would try to book a savannah view room if possible. Yes, there are plenty of places to view the animals from other spots within the hotel, but waking up and throwing open your balcony door to find some giraffes grazing right outside was REALLY AWESOME. 4) We've eaten at Jiko many times and this time was no exception. Really great wine selection, service, and food. Ask for their separate vegetarian menu if you don't eat meat - they have some great offerings. I believe the room service is also provided from Jiko's kitchen so that is a huge plus! 5) We also had some drinks at the bar that is located on the 2nd floor, and they were reasonably priced and good. The bar doesn't stay open very late; it closes at midnight. So if you want late night drinks, I would suggest buying something at the store inside of the hotel and then keeping it in your refrigerator in the room. 6) It was our first time trying out Boma, and we only went there for the breakfast buffet ($16.99). The food and service were good, but there was not a whole lot for vegetarians or healthy eaters. I know this IS Disney and hey, you ARE ON VACATION but some of us don't like to indulge at every meal, especially at breakfast. 7) We also ate at Mara, the counter-service operation. Food from there was good as well, and it was never 'crazy busy' when we went. 8) This hotel has one of the best gift shops of any Disney resort in my opinion. It is huge and offers it all (all sorts of toiletries, booze, drinks, snacks, along with a plethora of the usual Disney souvenirs). 9) My only gripe was the amount of time it took to get our tickets, that we had purchased online, turned into real tickets at the Front Desk (if you are a Florida resident, you must purchase the tickets online if you want to obtain the discount - they will not offer it at the hotels/parks). We waited so long that they finally gave us a credit on our room, which was much appreciated, but the time was still lost. 10) Valet is not really that expensive at $10/day. I've seen worse! But the self-parking was not that far from the entrance so that would be \"doable\" on a non-rainy day. 11) We walked to Kidani Village which was pleasant. Kidani is definitely BRAND SPANKING NEW and their restaurant, Sanaa, has a great menu and looks out over the savannah. We did not eat there however. 12) Room was spotless during our entire stay. Cannot fault the maid service at all. 13) Noise level was not that bad. We could hear the people above us in the bathroom, however, which was a bit annoying at times. And you cannot escape the noise of those powerful Disney toity flushes! 14) The pool area looked amazing, although we did not go in. Nice slide for the kiddies and a couple of spa areas for the parents. Plenty of life guards on duty. We stayed here using a 40% off coupon that we had received from Disney. Had we had to pay full price, I am not sure I would have felt like I had gotten my money's worth (due to the room size and lack of soundproofing).

Yuk! The bathroom tub was dirty and there was hair all over the blanket on one of the beds. The standard room had dust fly out of the coverlet on the bed. When my 4 year old starting sneezing the next day, I wasn't sure if it was a cold or allergies to the animals & dust in the room. By evening, he was very congested. He continued coughing, sneezing & eye rubbing throughout our stay. His symptoms improved after we left As far as the rest of the hotel goes, it's somewhat dark in the halls & rooms.

It jwas our very first trip to Disney, and we were not disappointed. It was a very nice resort. The lobby and grounds are beautiful and the rooms are fine. The bathroom area is large and roomy while the sleeping area is a bit small, but this was not a problem for us. We had no issues with housekeeping. Our room was cleaned well every day and on a few occasions when we requested extra items like bedrails and hangers they were brought up immediately. Staff overall was very accommodating. The best part of this resort is, of course, seeing the animals from the privacy of your own balcony. Prior to our visit, I had requested an Arusha savannah view on the 3rd floor. When we arrived, we got an Uzima savannah room (3510). I loved the location of this room since it was in the middle of the zebra trail and close to everything, however we rarely saw any animals in this savannah. I requested a room change and mid-week we were moved to the room directly opposite (3503) with a view of the Arusha savannah. This room was fabulous - we saw a wide variety of animals all day and it was again in the middle of the zebra trail so not a far walk from the lobby. I also liked being on the 3rd floor as it is the same floor where the lobby is located, plus it is at a good level for viewing the animals. This room also adjoined to another room, which is nice for large families that want to be next door to one another. The adjoining door area gave us a bit more space too, which was nice since the room is a bit on the small side. My son absolutely loved the pool. We couldn't get him out of it! The zero depth entry is nice for little ones, and the slide is great as well. He could go down it all by himself. The entire pool, except for a very small area in one corner, is pretty shallow, so it is ideal for preschoolers and grade schoolers. Teens and adults might find it a bit boring but we thought it was nice. We also went to both water parks and while our son had fun there, he preferred the resort's pool. The food at the resort was just ok. The food at Mara - the quick service restaurant - was pretty mediocre. We had the same Mickey waffles and scrambled eggs every day. There is not much variety and the food was bland. Boma was good but not great. Nice variety and flavors. Jiko was also good, but very expensive. I had the filet, my husband had the pork loin and our son had cheese pizza and the bill was $150. Again, a good meal but nothing outstanding and for the price I would have expected more. Our best meals of the week were at Artist Point at the Wildnerness Lodge and Ohana at the Polynesian resort. The food at Artist Point was fabulous and Ohana is a fixed menu restaurant where they bring the food to your table and it never stopped coming. The food was absolutely delicious and we didn't pay more than $70. We also ate at Chef Mickeys and the California Grill. Chef Mickeys is great for the kids so they can meet all the Disney characters, but the food is not very good at all. The California Grill was good but very expensive. We ate there late one night so we could see the fireworks from Magic Kingdom on their 15th floor observation deck. I feel that we paid for the atmosphere and view more than the food. We did enjoy watching the fireworks from the observation deck though. We were a little worried about booking this resort because of its far location from Magic Kingdom, but honestly we didn't have any transportation issues at all. Expect for on one occasion, the buses came frequently (every 5-10 minutes). We took the buses to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. The two days we went to MK and came home after the fireworks, we did have to stand up in the bus but that was to be expected. The buses came frequently and we were not waiting long at all. I was pleasantly surprised. So I don't think this resort's location is an issue. Transportation is quick and very well organized. We enjoyed our first trip to Disney very much, and this resort had a lot to do with it.

We booked our holiday through First choice and ended up paying \u00a34200 for the two of us. This included premium seating on the plane, 2 week ultimate park tickets and the Disney dinning plan. The flight was 9 hours long from East Midlands Airport and we would recommend the premium seating on the plane with First Choice/Thomson. I am 6 foot 1inch tall and I had pleanty of leg room and the 4 course meal was excellent and there was lots of leg room and a free bar,. We arrived at the Hotel at Midnight and after traveling for 9 hours we were just about ready to collaps as we were that tired. As we checked in the staff were very friendly. Back when we were booking the holiday in 2008 were couldn't decided if to book the Savana view room for an extra \u00a3600. I didn't in the end but as we arrived at the check in and looked at the amazing lobby a suddenly decided that I wanted a savana view room. As we checked in I asked the recepionist how much it would cost to upgrade to a Savana view room. She said we had a savana view room. I couldn't belive it and was glad we didn't pay the extra \u00a3600. We went up to our room and dumped the bags. The room was large, light and bright. There was bottled water in the fridge (tap water was not very nice as I found out) ready for us and a safe in the room. The bed was a kingsize bed and was very, very large. The view from the balcony was amazing. We had giraffe, buffalo and many other animals out side the window. During the trip all the staff were very friendly and helpfull. We had the Disney dinning plan and this saved us about \u00a325 a day in food. It cost \u00a350 a day for the two of us. This included a quick service meal (burger and chips, dessert and a drink), a snack (ice cream) and a table service meal (sit down meal, main course, dessert and a drink). We added the cost most days and it was about \u00a375 a day. It was expensie to eat at Disney and we could have eaten cheaper out of disney. Some of the better Disney restaurants required 2 table service meals. This did limit you to eat at Disney Restaurants. One evening we ventured out of Disney and went to Ponderosa steak house (steak and all you can eat buffet was \u00a36) this was excellent. The only problem was you have to tip everyone and we estimated that we spent \u00a312-\u00a315 a day in tips on the meals alone. Another tip if you eat in Disney, is book the restaurants in the UK before you go. We had problems booking into as they were all fully booked. You can book them online up to 180 days before you go. There was about 8 restaurants that we wanted to eat in but were all fully booked. Also you can buy a refillable mug for $12.99 (\u00a38) at the hotel and you can refill this as many times as you want during your trip at the disney resort hotels. The holiday was excellent and the hotel was top class. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We did vist every other Disney hotel and tried to have a drink in every bar. The other hotels that looked very good and would consider staying in next year are: 1. Grandfloridian 2. Coronado Springs 3. Yatch and Beach 4. Polynessian The Pool was large and there were about 4 life guards on duty every day. We did have a beer and a glass of wine in the bar. This cost us $14.50 (\u00a311). So we then decided to drive to Wallmart and we got a large case of beer and 2 bottles of wine for the same price.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cAfrican Paradise where tropical animals roam freely in the wildlife reserve surrounding your resort\u201d", "Author": "JSlarkey", "ReviewID": "UR39151443", "Content": "We stayed at the AKL from 9th August to the 23rd August 2009. Overall The AKL has the WOW factor in particular the lobby and landscape window looking out onto the Savannah. The attention to detail is excellent, especially the lights, shades, wooden d\u00e9cor on the room doors, panelling, carpets and furnishings etc. Even the lift doors have a giraffe embossed on the metal. Rooms We had a Uzima partial Savannah view (Room 4547) and were not disappointed; the wildlife roamed freely beneath our balcony, providing great photographic opportunities. So think again if you are considering paying the difference for a full Savannah view. The room although on the small size comfortably accommodated 2 adults and 2 children. We had a queen size and bunk beds. The room had a tastefully decorated African theme and cleanliness was excellent. However, there was a distinct lack of storage space; only 2 drawers to satisfy 4 people. So we had to live out of suitcases, which was inconvenient. The walk from the lobby to our room was a bit of a trek, approx 5-7 minutes, however, ideally situated for the pool and Mara restaurant. Pool The pool can get quite busy during the day, but not over crowded. The pool is designed for relaxing and not the serious swimmer. It is a lovely pool surrounded by green shrubs and trees, and has two spas. Access to the pool is easy; ideal for children as the deepest part is 4\u201911\u201d; plenty of sun loungers in and out of the shade; 4 life guards patrol the pool from 9 to 9; and pool towels are plentiful. The pool slide is on the tame side and therefore is preferable for under 8\u2019s. Food The AKL provided a wide choice of dining options. The Mara offered a counter service (fast food) dining option. The food was freshly prepared and tasty, although there was a limited choice of healthy options Boma offered a table service buffet dining experience. There was plenty of choice to suit everyone\u2019s taste and appetite. Jiko catered for the more discerning diner, providing a table service signature dining experience. Since our last visit (2003), we have noticed a significant increase in the price of food and drink. Therefore, for the British tourist, we would highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan. The plan we opted for included 1 table service meal, 1 counter service meal and 1 snack per person per day. And it may surprise you that we didn\u2019t utilise all our counter service meals during our stay. Without the dining plan you can expect to pay the following: \uf0d8 Table service meal costs on average $50 per head and includes a main course (steak or fish), dessert and soft beverage. \uf0d8 Counter service meal costs on average $15 per head and includes burger and chips, soft beverage and a dessert such as fruit or yogurt. \uf0d8 Snack costs on average $2.50 per head and includes one bottle of water or coke, coffee, an ice cream etc. You do the maths. Over 14 days, you would be expected to pay a minimum of $945 per person. So a family of 4 would pay $3,780 (equivalent to \u00a32362). In the US, waiters expect a tip. The going rate is 18%. For parties of 6 or more, this is automatically added to your bill. So you have to add this extra cost on top of your table service dining option. SO PLEASE CONSIDER DINING OPTIONS AND GET YOUR TRAVEL PROVIDER TO INCLUDE IT IN YOUR HOLIDAY. I would also recommend the refillable mugs. They cost $12 each but allow you to have unlimited refills of any soft beverage at the hotel. Staff We found the staff to be friendly. There was always a good morning and friendly banter. OK \u2018some\u2019 of the Waiters had an attitude, and cared more about the tip than the service. Transportation The AKL is remote from some Disney Parks and Attractions, however, is on the door step for the Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios and Epcot. No matter what other visitors say, our longest wait experience was 20 minutes and that only happened on 2 occasions, and we were living on the buses commuting between the Hotel and Parks. The bus service is regular to the AKL and if you have to queue then talk to your neighbour and have a laugh. You are on holiday! The buses can be often crowded particular in peak season, so be prepared to stand. It can sometimes be like sardines or peak times on the London Underground. But seats are often given up for woman and young children. Please feel free to email me about any details. General Disney Expectations As returning visitors to WDW, the previous visit being in 2003, we have noticed that Disney has lost some of its magic. Although we love Disney it still remains a wonderful place to visit, especially to the first time visitor. The principle of the dining plan is excellent as it saves you money overall. However, as there are 22 Disney hotels, the restaurants get booked up very early. What we noticed is that with the dining plan you are planning your holiday itinerary around restaurant availability, which takes away the fun, spontaneity and freedom of choice. Even when you have made a reservation, be prepared to wait up to 1 hour to be seated. It\u2019s is very frustrating especially as they recommend you check in 15 minutes before your scheduled time. Our experience this holiday was: \uf0d8 Chef Mickey\u2019s booked for 10:30 am seated 11:30 am \uf0d8 California Grill booked for 21:40 seated at 22:20 \uf0d8 Le Cellier booked for 14:45 seated 15:15 \uf0d8 Tusker\u2019s House booked for 10:20 am seated 11:10 am \uf0d8 Sci-Fi Restaurant booked for 19:30 seated 20:15 \uf0d8 Mama Melrose booked for 16:45 seated 17:30 \uf0d8 San Angel booked for 19:30 seated 20:20 We also tried \u2018Walk-ins\u2019 but found it very difficult to get a table except for the Rose and Crown where we managed lunch without the wait. The Fast Pass (FP) system has deteriorated. Again it is good in principle but for the most popular attractions and rides the allocations of FP\u2019s have gone by midday. So if you are \u2018not\u2019 in the Park early expect a stand-by wait up to 2 hours on the popular rides. For example, we got a FP at 10:00 am for the Toy Story ride in Hollywood Studios for our ride window at 15:15-16:15. We then had to wait a further 2 hours before we could use the FP again. Disney needs to learn from Universal Studios. We had a FP (paid extra for it though) that entitled us 1 FP per attraction available any time of day. You are then not planning your day around the FP system. Avoid the Extra Magic Hours in peak season. The FP does not apply and furthermore every man and his dog are there, so expect very long queuing times. For example, we queued 70 minutes to go on Soarin, 70 minutes for Test Track and 65 minutes for Mission Mars. We noticed that the Parks without the extra magic hours were quieter. The merchandise in the Disney shops is not as nice, and the choice is more limited, but prices have still inflated. It is not value for money. But if you are like us, it is always nice to bring back some mementoes. I recommend that if you are staying in a Disney Hotel and use the delivery service from the Parks to your Hotel, check your packages carefully, as on 2 occasions when using this service, the items were broken in transit. Disney did replace them, but if the hotel gift shop does not stock the item they will try and send elsewhere to exchange the item. So make a fuss and they will bring it into the shop. Disney is reactive to guest problems as opposed to proactive. I believe they are geared up to resolve problems. They probably see it as being cheaper to maintain. If you do have to complain, be prepared to be compensated by FP tickets for your inconvenience. And if the problem is severe, they will financially compensate you by refunding $X onto your hotel bill. This happened with us, as we were refunded $100 for our bad dining experience. So my advice is, complain and work the system to get FP Park tickets. I acknowledge it is not nice behaviour but seems to be the new Disney. Visitors with teenagers, who prefer more thrill rides, go to Universal as Disney are falling behind. They have let Universal catch up and overtake them. The Magic Kingdom is only for the younger visitor. My boys are aged 14 and 11 and soon got bored at the Magic Kingdom except for Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain. Unfortunately, Space Mountain was under refurbishment. I could go on but we will return to Disney, with our expectations better managed. Disney is still a magical place.

As you walk in through the doors, you are faced with the most amazing lobby you're ever likely to see. It really does impress and the rooms are beautifully decorated and appointed. To see a giraffe or zebra walking past your balcony is very special indeed. You really feel like you are looking out over an African Savannah and nothing about it seems 'man made'. The Uzima Pool area is also wonderful, the pool is great and is very relaxing which is a welcome break from the parks and the Hot Tub Jacuzzi's really do soothe those aching muscles after the amount of walking you do. We were lucky enough to be in the Jacuzzi when American child stars Zak and Cody of the Suite life and some of the other stars of the Disney Chanel were in there with us! They were superb and gladly posed with our nieces and other children for photographs which was priceless and made the kids holiday! I just love the shop at the hotel called Zawadi Market Place as along with sweets and chocolate, medication, drinks etc it also sells the most wonderful Aftrican carvings, paintings, instruments, and Disney clothing. I could browse around it for hours. The restaurants although very expensive are very good but the Mara Quick Service Food Court is fab. The food is of exceptional quality, varied choice and reasonable. The location is not a problem as you have to jump in the car or on the Disney Transport to go anywhere really so although some people have commented that it's a little far out, as Walt Disney World Resort is around 49 square miles, most places are a little far out if you're travelling to the other side of Disney! I would and do recommend this hotel to anyone who will listen and cant think of any downsides other than perhaps the restaurants being a little on the expensive side.

I slept for 2 days straight, when I got home and when I felt well enough to call the hotel, I was told I should have told the manager as soon as I noticed something wasn't right with my room and they would have done a special cleaning for me before I came. HERE is my point...NO ONE SAID WE'RE SORRY THIS HAPPENED! I never heard back from anyone at the resort. I sent an email and talked to a person on the phone. Even the great and wonderful Disney is wrong sometimes.... I wanted to warn them of a problem, make it better for the next person.

I had read reviews of the long bus rides from the Animal Kingdom Lodge but I guess I didn't fully appreciate the agony of the trips to and from the theme parks. Not only are the rides long but in the very least they are uncomfortably crowded and at the very most they are dangerous. When riding back from most theme parks the buses were over filled with people crowding every inch of the bus. Strollers block every egress point (in violation of the posted law). We finally just drove to the theme parks near the end of our trip. The drive was short and made for much more enjoyable trip. Now for the lodge itself. We were checked in by a very pleasant front desk attendant who explained every detail of the ticketing process, dining plan and hotel attractions. We had checked our luggage and valet parked our car for $10 per day. After finding our room we were hungry so the family went to eat at Mira, the quick serve restaurant. I called for our luggage and waited in the room, and waited, and waited, waited. After an hour I called and the attendant said they were busy. After waiting some more I went to pick up the luggage myself. They finally found the luggage and would not let me take it to my room. I had to wait for a bellman to bring the luggage. He was very polite and said he was sorry for the wait. This was the worst of the stay and everything else was great. The theme at the AKL is the best. The lobby, hallways and rooms are decorated in a tasteful African theme. We had a savanna view room where Zebras, Giraffe and Elk roamed not far from our window. It really is a great theme for all ages. Mousekeeping was great every day even though the the room was sometime made up late. After a long day at the parks it was nice to come back to a nice clean room and watch the animals from the balcony. The room itself is very small, especially for the price charged, but it was otherwise just fine. The beds are less comfortable than the average hotel. The AKL has 3 places to eat. We ate at Boma's and the quick serve restaurant Mira. Boma's was great and the Mira was fine for quick serve. The pool is large and attended by life guards during the day. It is still open at night without lifeguards but not as pleasant when foul mouth teens rule the water. There are two hot tubs but for some reason management put a smoking area right next to one of the hot tubs. Internet is an extra $10 per day so leave the work at well, work, and enjoy the animals at the AKL.

As others have stated, the bathroom is huge. In my opinion the bathroom could be a little smaller and the bedroom itself a little bigger but the glass shower, large closet and whirlpool tub are luxurious! The closet toilet is not as nice. The expansive deck was WONDERFUL! We sat on the deck mornings, afternoons and evenngs watching giraffe, ostrich, antelope, wildebeest and zebra interact each day. At times it was hard to not watch the animals. It was so unique and fabulous!!! We swam in the pool, it was not as big as i expected it to be but it was clean and well-staffed. The walk to the pool from rooms is long but it is an indoor walk through air-conditioned hallways so I am not sure what all the complaining is about. The reception area is smaller and more homey than the massive one in Jambo House, I like it better for DVC members...find it more welcoming. The only negatives I have is that our room was not ready when we arrived at noon, but check-in is at 4:00. Our room was ready a little after 2 p.m. Also, we were celebrating an anniversary and we received a knock on our door and a towel sculpture and photo pass after we had already been there for two nights.

Ever notice how they never have satisfaction surveys for your stay? Seeing the animals was nice but we were there very little since most of the time we were at the parks.I should also mention that you are picked up and dropped off before and after the other Animal resort that is there. Buses are not as frequent so waits will be longer. One day we waited for one hour at Animal Kingdom Park before a bus even showed. We all cheered with delight when one finally came.

Make sure you get the refill mug at $12 each as you can fill up all day as long as you are on the complex saves you a lot of money. The pool was fantastic lots of lifeguards and a slide for the kids but only a small one, there are some spa's which are nice for relaxation after a hard day at the Theme Park. The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble I had a wheelchair and it cost me nothing for the duration and was taken to all the parks, you can buy your tickets for the parks at the hotel and they are cheaper, they then put it on your key card which was really a good idea. The rooms are clean and bedding is changed on a regular basis along with the towels our room was not cleaned a few times but a quick phone call to housekeeper services and it was like the faries had been in along with the cleaner making disney faces with the towels on our return the children did find this fun even at teenager level. You do get extra access to the parks because you are in a Disney Hotel worth enquire about as during the day they do get over crowded. Also washing facilities at $2 a wash also $2 for drying no need to take the dirty clothes home with you at all. You can use the internet if you ask at he Reception for 15 mins free to keep in touch with the UK , no english channels on the TV and English newspapers at Downtown Disney at the Irish bar if you want one !!! I would find the room for 4 would be small but you could manage I was delighted with our two rooms and the kids could watch the TV late on at night without disturbing us after a long hard slog at the parks. This was our first vist and it won't be our last an exceptional Hotel and well worth the extra monies as it is very big with lots of rooms glad we had one near the reception area. There is a shop on site and sells a variety of goods including food / fancy goods worth a visit but expensive. All Disney is expensive get the Disney dinner plan if you are from the UK as you will benefit from this a great deal otherwise its deep pockets as remember they have the monopoly and there is no were else to go as you are restricted to the complex or the Parks. This did not put us off and we had a fantastic time the best holiday - now we are looking to go again in the not too distant future.

There aren't many places in the world where you can do this for $159 a night. When we first arrived at this resort, it was like were arriving at a remote, exotic place. The vegetation, decor, and all the surroundings really make you feel like you could be in Africa- not in a resort hotel just a few minutes away from giant amusement parks. The lobby is beautifully and elegantly decorated. There is plenty of comfortable seating, and it never seemed crowded while we were there. There are cast members everywhere waiting to answer questions and be of service. I never had a problem finding help when I needed it, and everyone was very friendly. I only had to wait a couple of minutes to check in, and I visited the concierge desk several times. There were never lines. The hotel is HUGE, and our room was near the back of the hotel, so we had quite a walk. But the hallways are so nice, and there are views of the animals as you walk down the halls, so this was not a problem for us. You can also get complimentary wheelchair access if you have guests in your party who have difficulty walking. You also have the chance to request a room near the front (we preferred having a room at the back to see more animals). We booked a standard view room, but they gave us a Sunset Savanna view, nonetheless. They considered it to be \"partially obstructed\" because there were some fences below our balcony, but we saw animals every morning. We usually saw 6 giraffes, three zebras, several ankole cattle, some birds, some wildebeests, and some other types as well. They gathered back there for morning feedings, so it was a perfect time to sit on the balcony with a cup of coffee and enjoy. Even if you don't have a room with a great view, you can see plenty of animals. All along the hallways are public balconies where you can sit and rock in huge wooden rocking chairs and watch them. We sat there several times for a different view and to rock in the chairs. There was hardly ever anyone on these balconies, so it was like having them to ourselves. The rooms are very nice. We had four adults and a 2 year old in our one room, so it was a little tight, but we got along just fine. The decor is really nice, the beds are firm but comfortable, and there is plenty of storage space for clothing. The bathroom was small but elegant, and we liked that the sinks were not inside the same room as the toilet and the shower. The balconies are a nice size. You can't really sit down for a breakfast for four out there, but for just sitting to relax and watch the animals, they don't need to be any bigger. The pool is fabulous. There is a zero depth entry, which my two year old loved. She could walk right into the water without being scared. The water was clean and felt great in the afternoons after a hot day at the park. We watched the flamingos near the pool and she played on the playground. There were always plenty of chairs and towels, though perhaps not enough umbrellas for everyone. The pool never seemed too crowded. There are two spas, which were wonderful for massaging and comforting tired, sore muscles after a long day at the park. They were never crowded, and a few times I had the spa all to myself. The food was very good. We ate at both The Mara and Jiko, though we did not eat the buffet at Boma. The Mara actually pleased my husband, who is a bit of a food snob. He thought it was quite good, as did my mom and my sister. The food at Jiko was amazing. I ate scallops, which were perfectly cooked and came with a delicious cucumber salad, and my husband had the braised beef short ribs. The meat melted in the mouth. It was very expensive- our meal for the two of us was $120 which included one appetizer, two entrees, one beer, and one specialty cocktail. The service was not great. Our server was a little casual for our taste at such a restaurant, but it was okay. Nice ambience in the restaurant. We had a view of the resort pool from our table. Although we chose Jiko because my husband does not like buffets, I would probably skip Jiko next time and try Boma. From what I could tell, you probably get more for your money- and you get a much larger variety. For the price we paid, I think the location was fine. Although I would certainly prefer to ride the monorail to the parks, I don't think it is worth the extra money to stay at one of the monorail hotels. We had a car and drove to the park the first day, but thereafter decided to ride the buses. It took about the same amount of time to ride the buses as it did to drive, when you consider that the buses drop you off right in front of the parks and you don't have to bother with the huge parking lots or riding trams. We never had to wait long for a bus, and we never missed a bus due to large crowds, though sometimes we did have to stand. I had a large stroller, but it was not a problem getting it on and off the bus quickly, as the crowds were not too large. I would not, however, want to handle a stroller and a child by myself on the buses. You need at least two people for that. Another thing I love about this hotel was the willingness of the staff to make our stay as nice as possible. My mom developed a problem with her leg from walking so much, so I asked about renting a wheelchair. The bellhop said he could get her one that she could use for the entire length of her stay. She could even take it to the parks with her- free of charge. He immediately brought one out and gave it to us. I thought that was very nice. We had only a couple of small issues while we were here. It took about twenty-five minutes to get our luggage after we arrived, because they were slow getting it up to our room. It wasn't a big inconvenience, but we did have to sit and wait in the room for a little while. That wasn't too bad, since we had a nice view of the animals. Our refrigerator did not work, but quickly after we called they sent someone up who brought another refrigerator. We also found a lipstick stain on one of the glasses. Other than those minor things, we had no concerns whatsoever. All in all, we loved this hotel. I don't think you can beat it for the price, the service, and the ambiance. It is great for all ages. Everyone in my party had fun- from my 67 year old mother to my 2 1/2 year old daughter.

Magical Express \u2013 used this to and from the airport and thought it was a great service. The trip to the hotel took slightly longer as the bus was busy and we dropped off at 3 hotels before getting to AKL which was slightly annoying after a long flight. Check in was a breeze, despite being a Saturday which seemed to be one of the busier days for arrivals. Took less than 5 minutes. Room - mine was on the Kudu trail. After reading other reviews on Tripadvisor, when we booked we had requested rooms that were near to the lobby/restaurants. I was on the 4th floor with a partial Savannah view. The room was immaculate, not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere. The rooms are a little dark but like others have said its in keeping with the resorts theme. I found the room to be plenty big enough, with ample storage space. Beds were comfortable, no problem with the air conditioning, plenty of clean towels and toiletries provided. Was great being able to sit on the balcony and watch the animals outside. I would not pay the extra for a Savannah view room because even if you aren't lucky enough to get a partial view there are so many places around the hotel where you can view the animals I don't think it is worth the additional expense. Pool - we spent most of our days around the pool, choosing to visit the parks in the evening when the weather was slightly cooler. The pool didn't start to get busy until 10/11am. We always tended to arrive before then so could get seats in our favourite spot, just behind the pool and right by the bar!! The lounger\u2019s right around the pool were always taken by lunchtime when the pool was at its busiest. However we always managed to get chairs even if we came down in the late afternoon. Plenty of towels available. Lifeguards on duty for most of the day and were really attentive. Great slide that the children loved. Dining - ate in Boma for breakfast and dinner. Was a little disappointed both times after reading such great reviews here, maybe I was expecting too much. I thought dinner was better than breakfast - prime beef was amazing. Did not eat in Jiko myself but some of my family did and really enjoyed it. We ate breakfast and lunch most days from Mara, I thought there was a good selection and prices were reasonable for a resort hotel. The one thing we all thought was missing from the hotel was just a normal restaurant \u2013 so not a fine dining one like Jiko or a buffet like Boma. Somewhere to grab some lunch without having to go and get it from Mara. Would have been nice to enjoy a bite to eat at the pool bar for example. Transportation \u2013 other reviews have complained about the length of time either waiting for a bus or the time it took to get to the various parks. We did not experience any of these problems. Only once we had to wait in a long line at Magic Kingdom for about 40 mins. Other than that the buses always arrived promptly and I thought the system worked very well. Yes the ride could take up to 15 mins but it was nice to get a break to sit down in an air conditioned bus! Overall, I thought this was a fantastic hotel. All public areas and rooms spotless. Staff were friendly and helpful as you would expect at a Disney hotel. There were lots of viewing places to watch the animals and despite going during the busy season there was always somewhere to sit.

We had been planning our 10 year anniversary for over a year now and we were very excited as the days counted down. If you have never experienced this place before, prepare yourself as you walk through the main doors. You need to stop and just soak in the scenery as you enter. It will literally take your breath away. From endless couches to lounge on, to a TV area playing cartoons for big and little kids to watch, to a fantastic collection of artifacts from Africa found THROUGHOUT the entire resort\u2026you will be absolutely amazed. I know I was. We DID have a bit of a hiccup during check-in (which we had NO wait for and were checking in about 4:30PM on a Sunday). When we had made the reservations back in March, we knew that what we were asking for were just \u201crequests\u201d, but when we called back in April to pay off the trip, we were \u201ctold\u201d what room we were going to be getting\u2026down to the floor and view\u2026which made us happy because it was all what we wanted. This was not the case when we checked in. We were expecting to be on the 3rd floor facing towards the main circular savannah, but we ended up on the 4th floor facing the left savannah. We had a lovely post blocking our view and very rarely had any animals to see. So word of advice\u2026if you\u2019ve been talking to Disney via the phone and they give you specifics about room and location, you might want to take it with a grain of salt OR confirm it a week before you check-in. Be sure and get ALL names. We told the customer service lady this and she actually told us to complain. Meh\u2026just one bump in the road. We really wanted a nice vacation, so we made the best of it. Besides, we got to see a darling Eland just about every time we looked out our sliding door. The decorations for the rooms are quite impressive. Keeping with the theme, you will see animals in nearly everything in your room\u2026from the Lion King animals in the curtains (behind the drapes) to the hidden Mickeys you\u2019ll see throughout the resort in the carpets, comforters and shower curtains. The wallpaper in the bathroom is very neat. Dual sinks perfect for just the two of us. There are shower and bath combos. Always plenty of towels (housekeeping here is wonderful). A nice ceiling fan you can turn on and off with the flip of a switch. BIG TV! Just the attention to details is phenomenal. It made for a very memorable stay. We had the two queen bed setup and unfortunately we had horrible sleep while staying here. I know, I know\u2026more complaining. I wish I didn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to, but I have to share my experience. The sheets are extremely uncomfortable\u2026almost felt like plastic. I actually had to take sleep medicine nearly every night to make myself fall asleep. This part actually made the stay not pleasant, but we really tried to make the best of it. If you are able to fall asleep on just about anything, then you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. I agree with what others say when they mention that the rooms were small. It was absolutely perfect for just the two of us, but with a family of four or more\u2026I can imagine it getting downright cramped! As for the sheets, if we ever decide to stay on Disney property again, we may decide to bring our own. And a bit of advice for parents with small children\u2026you might want to put in a request about NOT being next to newlyweds. I\u2019m quite sure we were next to some \u2026and well\u2026they were consummating their marriage nearly EVERY night and were quite loud about it too. Yeah\u2026thin walls I guess. But it IS a hotel! No biggie, but I thought I\u2019d throw that out there. Even though we didn\u2019t see many animals from our room, they do provide a list of what you can find and even a place to mark off what you\u2019ve seen. They also add identification pointers and behavior tips too. Very cool. We even had the pleasure of talking to several cast members while roaming out in the Arusha Rock Savannah Overlook. We learned a lot about Elands and cows. Another nice touch is the \u201cwelcome home\u201d you will receive each time you come through the security check. It\u2019s very pleasant to receive after a long day of playing at the parks. People who are driving will get to experience this. You might not get to if you are taking the bus. If you ARE driving, you will get free parking at all the parks. Parking now is $12 for cars. OUCH! There is LOTS of parking for the Animal Kingdom Lodge and some people complain that it\u2019s too far from the main door. But there are LOTS of rooms for this enormous resort, so you need someplace for these folks to park! It\u2019s Disney, you will be walking almost the whole time anyways. It\u2019s all part of the experience. If you just can\u2019t stand the walk, they have valet parking available. There\u2019s always somebody at the front waiting to help you out. The Animal Kingdom Lodge definitely has an impressive staff THAT\u2019S for sure. We were very impressed with everybody that we talked to there. We ate at two of the restaurants at the hotel (see my other reviews for these). We had breakfast at both Boma and The Mara. If I could have Boma for breakfast every day for the rest of my life\u2026I would die a happy person. It is a buffet full service restaurant and they are always preparing food to make sure the bowls are FILLED. The Mara is your usual quick service\u2026waffles and eggs type\u2026which was good. We didn\u2019t experience either of these for lunch or dinner, but Boma always seemed busy. We always heard lots of drums playing down there in the PM. Such a wondrous experience for those dining I\u2019m sure. We only nosed around the resort for a little bit during our stay, but what we saw was really nice. They have a very big spacious swimming pool which always had lots of people in it when we walked by. Life guards were on duty. The Mara is located right next to the pool as was Pumba\u2019s Fun and Games Arcade. I was able to mail a bill in the room located just to the right of the Lobby Concierge. You can also find internet and payphone access in the same room. They also have a gift shop located just beside the main doors. Here you will find souvenirs that you can only get at The Animal Kingdom Lodge and then there are the usual goodies you can get throughout the parks. Also there\u2019s a little \u201cconvenience\u201d section in case you forgot to bring something\u2026bathroom stuff, etc. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at this resort! There were so many more good things that we experienced than bad. I saw so many smiles on children and adults alike that it was just contagious. It\u2019s such a happy place and something that you just have to experience for yourself. If you are staying here in the future\u2026be prepared to be amazed. You are so LUCKY!!!

Rooms are the same, great theming albeit rather dark and at times the lighting is just not sufficient. Very nice main pool with lavish foliage and waterslide. BUT... AKL is SO large and spread out that you can literally get lost in it. It has a strange layout...the lucky ones were close to the lobby, we were not so lucky. There are also some extremely LONG hallways which lead to some rooms that make you feel quite isolated. If you like to feel as though you're part of the action, you won't if you're at the end of the hall...it feels as though you're off in no-man's land. When we saw the standard room we were given, with it's not-too-thrilling view of the parking area, we politely asked to switch rooms. NOTHING else available--in the entire, enormous resort--unless of course we wanted to pay more. And it was expressed quite rudely, too. This is the first time I've ever experienced such a lack of helpfulness, accommodation or understanding; usually Disney tries to make their guests happy but by the unfriendly staff's demeanor, I could tell they were not about to go even an extra millimeter or do anything remotely accommodating to help us out. Our only options were to pay $15 more for a pool view, or $75 more for a Savannah view. Figuring that this would give us a rare opportunity to see animals up close, we opted to pay the $75 extra and go with the Savannah view--after all it IS the AK Lodge, seeing animals is what it's all about, right? This is where the extremely long walk to our room came in...we found ourselves having to be escorted (the attendant said he didn't want us to get lost, since the route from the lobby to the rooms is \"very confusing\"--no kidding) down hall after hall, finally to nearly the last room on what seemed to be an endless and empty hallway. Frankly, it bothered us to be so isolated and removed, but we tried to focus on the positive and were eager to see the view, which the front desk called \"one of the best savannah views.\" Wow, what a disappointment. Yes, there were animals, although very far away--but I didn't have any illusions that they'd be right outside our balcony all day long. But in this supposedly great Savannah view room on the edge of the resort, we also got to see the high chain-link fencing, the large gate where the vehicles enter and exit, some sort of utility building, associated machinery/equipment, etc, and a striking lack of natural beauty--no grass, few bushes, trees were well off into the distance...mainly just dusty desolate acreage. And it seemed like the animals were rather avoiding this area too; I don't blame them, it really was a rather depressing sight. I loathed dragging my family around to switch rooms yet again, but common sense prevailed to say \"why are we paying $75 more for THIS?\" So, I went to the lobby while my family waited and switched rooms again...for a pool view. Most pool view rooms are partially or fully obstructed by some sort of foliage which, while lovely, natural, fits in with the theme etc., really does need to be trimmed or managed so that those who want a pool view are actually getting one. But at least when we were above the pool we could again hear music and activity, see other people and hear happy voices in the air, like we were actually at a Disney resort. We learned that we don't like to feel that isolated. Some people might...it just wasn't what we wanted. Also note: these rooms are noticeably smaller than nearly all other deluxe resorts--hence the lower price. The bus situation is pitiful--a real knock when you have sleepy children who need to get back to their room. The distance from nearly ALL the parks was quite a disadvantage at AKL. This resort made up my mind that I'll never stay this far from the parks again. WDW being about 48 square miles, it's an arduous journey back at the end of the night--even IF you're lucky enough to catch the first bus...don't be surprised if you have to wait for the next one. And there's no such thing as a quick afternoon break to use the pool at your resort--AKL's just too far away to make any midday break practical unless you really cut into your day. If you absolutely love animals you'll love this resort. But for us it was a bit different, perhaps in part because the expectation is built up so high with regard to the animal viewing, theming etc., that after a couple minutes we were already thinking: \"Okay, it's a giraffe...it's lovely...and pretty much looks exactly like the one we just saw at the Animal Kingdom. Very nice. Not thrilling, but nice...\" It is pleasant to see them out of your hotel window; for some guests, this may make all the difference. However, I found a lot more enjoyment seeing the animals from the observation deck at the end of the hall (in lush surroundings that look a lot more pleasant for the animals, since it was the INTERIOR courtyard) than from that savannah view room--the cost difference didn't seem worth it AT ALL--or by simply going to the Animal Kingdom itself. The distance and location of AKL simply overshadowed our enjoyment of this resort such that we're unlikely to return. We're glad we tried it, but see no compelling reason to ever go back.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chazanddi", "ReviewID": "UR36013650", "Content": "Better late than never review .

Check in went very quickly and smoothly - arrived at 3pm after just over an hours drive from Sanford International. Only slight down side was that it was difficult to understand the check-in clerks accent even though his disney badge said he was from London! However he was very informative and went over all of the hotel amienities and recommended booking for Jiko and Boma - we had done this from home already! After explaining on the map how to get to our room we made our way there. Our room (2484) was on the second floor although from the lobby this is actually down one level. The lobby is actually on level 3! After 5 minutes the luggage arrived and we were very pleased by what we saw. I was staying with my mum so had 2 queen size beds. The room was not at all dark and although we had a standard room we saw giraffes nearly every day from our balcony - bonus! Overall I can't fault the room or location. We ate at Boma during our stay - fantastic - one of the best meals we had at Disney. We had booked - via the american disney internet site - and I would thouroughly recommed doing this. The restaurant was VERY busy. We stood in queues for up to 10 minutes at a time to pick our food from the buffet. It was worth it though. Try the Zebra Domes - pudding - they are delicious. We also ate alot at The Mara - the quick service restaurant - serving burgers, chicken nuggets , pizzas and soups. A quick and simple way to grab something to eat between trips to the parks. Buy a refillable mug - about $13 - you can refill it with soft drinks, tea, coffee and hot chocolate as many times as you want for your entire stay! $13 for a 2 week stay was well worth it. The disney bus service to the parks was excellent. The longest we stood at the hotel or a park waiting for a bus was 15 minutes - and that was on the 4th of July at the Magic Kingdom after the fireworks! If you arrive at the hotel bus stop and see your bus leaving wave at it - more often than not the bus driver will stop for you! A word of warning. The Animal Kingdom Lodge now has 2 bus stops - Kidani Village and Jambo House. The first stop on the way back from the parks is usually Kidani Village (Disney Vacation Club Members) do not get off here! We and several other people we spoke to made this mistake. The two parts of the hotel are Not joined and it is a good 15 minute walk in the blistering heat back to Jambo House - the original Hotel! Remember to stay on the bus - some drivers warn you , others do not!

There were plenty of animals roaming around, and the night goggles viewing is an experience you should try. I don't know why people complain sometimes about the bus service, and the lodge being a little further away from some of the parks. It's a bad rap because I didn't wait for a bus for more than 15-20 minutes the entire week I was there. The longest ride I had was only 20 minutes to Magic Kingdom. The food at Boma's was very good, both the breakfast & dinner buffets. A nice place to finish the night is at Victoria Falls, the hotel bar right above Boma's. It's small but friendly, and the bartenders are really nice and make great mixed drinks, try the rum runners or mudslides. The pool is also nice and roomy.

The rooms are a bit small but other than that I have nothing bad to say. Our savana view was great. It brought tears to my husband's eyes. He is such a softy. We were there for nine days and the only bad experience was one of the cast members in guest services had a little attitude. Room service every morning and never had to wait over 30 minutes. I recommend room service for breakfast as the only other choice is the buffet and it is 16.99 per adult. You can get full breakfast for less than that thru room service. Recommend 1 order of the Continental Breakfast for two adults. It includes large pot of coffee and a basket full of pastries and juice. This is only $11.99. It is the best deal on the menu. The pool was very nice and you also have privledges at Kidani Village which is less than a 10 minute walk from the Jambo House. Kidani Village is the new area of the AK lodge that was built for the Vacation Club members. Pool is very, very nice and great area for children. The housekeeping staff was amazing. They cleaned our room every day. When I say \"cleaned\" I mean vacuum, scrub shower and sinks, and so on. More than just making the beds. I also recommend that you get a car if you are staying at the AK lodge. (Great self parking area/very close to lobby entrance). It is on the very edge of Disney property and you can be in the city in less than 5 minutes. This opens up your options for eating and sight seeing. We took an air boat ride on Lake Toho.

The lodge and it amenities are wonderful! We truly felt like we were transported away from it all at this location. We rented points from a DVC member for a suite and paid approximately $145 a night for our accommodations. As great as this place is, I'm not sure I would spend around approximately the $250 - $350 rate the resort would charge for similar accommodations. There were some minor negatives as related below (Check In & Check Out). Check In - It took us a while to check in. The person who checked us in gave the typical Disney speech \"Welcome home, . . .\" however she said it in a montone without smiling and we felt as if we were bothering her. My husband and I noticed that the girl at the next check out stand had the same monologe but was animated and smiling. She went out of her way to give restaurant recommendations and make sure sure the guests knew special events happening that day. Our person did no such thing. She bascially handed us our packet and told us how much we owed for the Disney Dining Plan. We had checked in advance to make sure we could pay for the Dining Plan with gift cards and were informed it would not be a problem. Well, it was. Our attendant didn't know how to process the cards and then told us that people usually don't pay that way. She got some assistance and put them through. Unfortunately $200 worth wouldn't go through. She said we had probably used them in the parks and said we could pay the rest with a credit card. When we told her no such thing had happened and asked if she could try manually importing the number or calling she again restated that we had probably used the cards. We were told that we could take the cards back and get the credit later. We knew we hadn't used the cards and getting a Disney credit later wouldn't really be helpful as we would have left the area. The clerk finally agreed to keep the cards and try them later through a computer link. Everything did finally work out and the clerk left a message on our room's phone to apologize for the problem . Later someone told us that they always have difficulties with gift cards because the cards get demagnetized and people shouldn't use them. If this is the case, then they should have told us this when we first inquired. The clerk told us we would be called later to let us know when the room was available. This never happened, so once again we had to wait in the check-in lane to get our room assignment. The clerk who helped us this time was very friendly and helpful. Lobby & Room - The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. It might seem a little dark during the daytime, however, it's real beauty shines through at night when it is lit in a soft glow. Our room was clean and had a microwave, toaster, refrigerator, coffee maker, and paper goods for eating. Ample towels were provided for our stay. The room was average in size when compared to other hotels, however, it's the detail given to decorating and bedding that make it exceptional. Disney is great with the details at their resorts! Savannah Views - Not all Savannah view rooms are the same. I'n not sure of it's name, but I would recommend the rooms on the back end of Jambo house. We had a room facing the \"feeding area\" of a savannah but did not see many animals, instead we saw more people performing maintenance. However, it was a thrill to my children to walk out and see the animals from the back of the resort. The people stationed there were always helpful and tried to answer any questions we had. Ammenities - There are so many activities and amenities at this resort! The kids loved the night goggle vision, crayon rubbing, and pool. You could easily spend several days just at the resort and never touch the parks. Dining - Bomas was our favorite restaurant from all of the places we ate. The servers were friendly and all of their recommendations were excellent choices. My children loved the food at this restaurant, howvever it's not your typical fare. If you have picky eaters or like traditional American food then this restaurant may not be for you. We also dined at their quick service counter and found the food here to be good too. The quick service has menu items that appeall to young children (pizza, chicken nuggets) as well as adults. You can visit a website (I think its www. allears.net) to pull up the menus and pricing at various Disney restaurants. This might be helpful in finding restaurants that will appeal to the people in your group. Transportation - Can't comment as we used our car to get around. When you stay at a Disney resort you also get free parking at the theme parks. It did appear that the shuttle came around every 20-30 minutes. Check Out/Bell Service - At the end of our stay we asked for bell service to take our luggage and souvenirs to the car. After waiting almost 30 minutes we called again to see how long it would be. They said they didn't have our name on the list and it would be another 20 minutes. At this point we said to just forget it and we would do it ourself and asked if we could come get a luggage cart. We were told no, carts are only for bell service. However, this time the girl at bell service would be there within 5 minutes. The gentleman who showed up was very helpful and apologized for the wait. It turned out he orginally lived 30 minutes away from us and we had a nice discussion as he got the luggage to the car.

Arrival - Typical Disney style. Hopped on a bus at the airport and was driven to the resort. About an hour drive in a comfortable air-conditioned bus. Check-in - Went very fast. From the time we entered the resort to the time we were in our room was only about 30 minutes and that was only because we had lots of questions that got answered while checking in. Room - Very clean and again was typical Disney but not cheesy. The room had subtle hints of Disney all around but some of it blended in very well to where you almost didn't notice it. We had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable. Either that or we were just to tired at the end of the day to notice. The bathroom was divided with the sink and mirrors outside of the bath/shower and toilet part. The best part for me was the balcony watching the animals. Pool - I'm not a pool person so I didn't spend any time in it but it looked very nice and a lot of people seemed to enjoy it. There were tons of chairs to lounge in and a bar next to it. (not a swim up bar though) Food - We ate at the buffet restaurant most nights and it was very good, but the variety didn't change much. Luckily there were lots of choices. (try the amarula ball desert - incredible!) The small cafeteria area by the pool was good and served stuff like pizza, french fries, chicken sticks. My recommendation would be to purchase the meal and quick meal options before you go. You can save a lot in the long run, especially in the parks. Activities - Lots to choose from! We were out late most nights at the theme parks but the ones we participated in were the nightvision animal viewing and story telling by the firepit. Kind of cheesy but fun and family safe. Animals - Best part of the lodge for me! I was very disappointed the first night we got in cause I sat out and waited to see some of the animals and didn't see a single one. But the next day and all the days after we always had Giraffes, Greater Kuku's, and Ankole Cattle outside our balcony with an occasional visit from other animals. The zebras tended to stay in the middle part of the resort and the impalas and nyalas stayed on the pool side, but all were visible from different spots at the resort. The animals seemed to be well taken care of and the grounds keepers did a fantastic job at \"picking up after them\". Complaints - I'm going to have to pick a little here just to find something to gripe about. Prices were high in the gift shop, but what else can you expect from Disney. The only person we had a problem with was the lady at the Disney Cruise booth. We were trying to change our cruise information and she wouldn't help us and told us to contact their phone number. (minor detail) And the family staying next to us had a very \"excited\" young boy that was very loud. There were other minor little details here and there but nothing to write about. The high prices and loud neighbors are what kept me from giving this 5 stars. Overall, an awesome experience!

It is an artistic rendering of Africa, clearly not meant to be Africa, with the exception of the Savannah, but the salute is lovely. The art work is all authentic and a pleasure to behold. It was fun to talk with the employees from Africa who were all very friendly and open to our questions about their homeland and culture. On this visit we had four adults, three children 9,7 and 4 and two teenagers 15 and 13 in our group. CHECK IN: We were immediately greeted by valet and bell services upon arrival. Our items were put in storage until our room was ready. I utilized their new online check in and was able to go to a special queue upon arrival but since the lobby was empty it didn't make much of a difference to my check-in. I still had to go through the routine of verifying my address, etc so I didn't see much point. The only thing different was that they already had my credit card number. I was able to add my dining plan at the check in desk but I had to go to concierge to add my park passes. I don't recall ever having to do that before. I wish we could do that in the online check in process, now that would make a difference! Our room was also not ready until after 5 p.m. which was rather inconvenient as it made us late for our dinner reservations because we wanted to freshen up (We ended up missing the dinner entirely, read below) THE HOTEL : The Jambo House lobby is far more impressive than the small but beautiful Kidani Village lobby. Following a theme which are true to their roots, Jambo is more akin to a large ceremonial house and Kidani is more like a home or small village. They each exhibit traditional African architectural styles. Kidani still looks a bit barren at the moment, but that is because the Village has only just opened and the plants have not had a chance to really take root and flourish whereas on the Jambo side, well, we often commented that we felt like we were really in a jungle. What an experience to walk out on to our balcony at any time, day or night and see magnificent giraffes, zebras, pelicans, cranes, wildebeests, ostriches, emus, flamingos, well lets just say there were plenty of animals to watch. The Savannah has feeding stations set near the rooms so the animals will definitely stop by, but even when they weren't eating they had no problem hanging out near the people, screaming kids, whistling grown-ups, whatever the humans were doing didn't seem to make them run off. We even had the chance to watch them weather a severe lightning and rain storm at 2 a.m.. They just stood there nonchalantly chewing, I was a wreck. Turns out there were almost 19,000 lightning strikes during the storm (thanks Doppler radar, some things I don't actually need to know LOL). The point is it was interesting to learn that their reaction was not what I had expected. THE ROOMS: We are DVC members and rented a studio and a two bedroom suite in the Jambo House. I cannot imagine paying the 'asking' price of nearly $13,000 for the seven nights we had these accommodations but I guess someone does. The rooms were a few doors away from each other. Both were Savannah View rentals. Rooms without a Savannah view looked over gardens, the pool, or had a distant view of the parking lot. Everyone has access to the Savannah in the halls and the lobby. Guests not staying at the resort are not permitted to use this resort's pools or attend it's activities. They may dine at it's restaurants. Having said that, I'm not sure how they would know you weren't a guest as they don't police it like they do at the Yacht and Beach Club. The studio room and two bedroom suite are nicely decorated, as expected, better than the average hotel, with cute Lion King carvings, tile decor and not so hidden Mickey's on the bed, carpet, shower curtain and even the furniture. They studio is of average size for a hotel room, and the two bedroom was a studio attached to a one bedroom suite. ** TIP: I would check with members of your party to see if anyone has an issue with sleeping on a sofa bed. Big teens may not find it any more comfortable than an adult would. My 13 year old son is taller than I am and found it uncomfortable. Our 15 year old slightly built daughter ended up sleeping there and said it was OK but was glad she only weighs 100 because the mattress was thin. I am 5'6\" and weigh 200lbs and found it uncomfortable. ** The regular beds were VERY comfortable and all the pillows and sheets felt luscious and soft and were pleasingly white. The blankets were nice, but we had to remove the comforter because it felt so heavy on our tired feet! We had everything we needed in the kitchen except dishwasher soap which was supplied to us for free when we tried to buy some in the store. **TIP: I suggest you seriously think about your needs before arriving and shop at the local Publix or Winn Dixie. The on site store is very expensive. Water in the park is $2.50 a bottle. We buy a few cases freeze them the night before and drink them as they melt while in the park. We had two a piece this trip but it was convenient because we had a stroller, normally we only carry one a piece. Yes there are water fountains in the park-but FL water is a bit unpleasant to the palette and Disney does not make any effort to keep the fountains cold. ** I really liked the square plates and animal print on the coffee cups. Yes I'm a nerd. My only real difficulty was with the lighting in the bathroom. The interior lighting of the resort and rooms is rather dim. The resort is dedicated to energy conservation and uses fluorescent bulbs, and I think in view of the African theme maybe we were supposed to be in \"fire light\", and maybe they needed it dim on the balconies (because there was no light at all) to minimize disturbing the animals, but the light in the bathroom made it impossible to apply make up without holding a mirror. I think this problem could be fixed by attaching a make-up mirror on an expendable arm to the wall that either lights up itself or reaches the light illuminating the sink. I assume though that older guests or guests with partial blindness may find this 'feature' rather difficult to deal with. WHAT TO DO: There is a huge list of activities to attend at this resort. If you can it is worth it to build a day into your schedule to spend at the resort attending these activities. Almost all of them are free. They are like participating in a National Geographic show. The little ones in our group loved it. Our teenagers, not so much, but they happen to be avid readers so they knew a lot of the info offered. For casual observers not interested in 'signing up' for an activity there is night viewing of the animals with night vision binoculars, story telling by a fire, and lots of employees on hand to tell you whatever you wanted to know about the animals on the Savannah. The Jambo Pool and slide are lovely with beautiful plants shading many areas from the harsh sun. We never had any trouble getting a lounge chair. The flamingos which hang out in their own area are a must see. The new Kidani pool was a blast, in particular the \"Uwanja Camp\" kid's area which feature water falls, spray guns, rope bridges and a mini slide for the kids to play in. We had a blast squirting each other 'defending' the fort. Yes the teens got into this activity with the little ones. Smiles all around. DINING: On our first night we had 5:15 reservations for Sanaa, Kidani's table service restaurant. Unfortunately after making sure we got on the correct bus (DownTown Disney) we were taken to DownTown Disney (DTD) instead of the Kidani Village which was supposed to be the next stop before heading to DTD. The bus driver admitted he had gone to Kidani first instead of Jambo. We ended up not being able to eat for another 2 1/2 hours which was not an impressive way to start our first night of vacation. We ate at the counter service Mara's three nights. The veggie pizza, African stew, fallafel, chicken pita and bacon double cheeseburger were all very good. The employees were all very nice as well. In the past we have eaten at Boma's, a buffet with African and American food. It is always booked and always loud. The atmosphere, food and service are very good, definitely a family friendly restaurant and worth the table service coupon on the dining plan. When we missed eating at Sanaa we decided to give up a reservation at EPCOT and use two table service vouchers at Jikos instead. We felt guilty about bringing three little kids to this fine dining establishment but were immediately made comfortable when they put us in a room with other kids separate from the adult diners. Our waiter was quick and efficient, friendly and very knowledgeable about the wine. We were very happy with his advice and enjoyed what we were served. The food was absolutely delicious, in particular the ostrich appetizer, lamb, scallop and steak entrees and the pistachio brulee dessert. I have stayed at almost all of Disney's Resorts, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is a jewel in Disney's crown. I never expect everything to go absolutely perfect, so the few inconveniences (late room, bus driver who went to the wrong location) we experienced did not mar this lovely resort's reputation for me. Besides, as soon a I spoke with anyone about these problems we were apologized to and given a perk (Fast Passes, I know they're free, but we could use them anywhere, didn't have to rush to get them so they were much appreciated). I think given their volume of guests Disney does a fantastic job and handles glitches well. I have never actually spent $8000 on a room for a week so I don't know how to compare it's value with another $8000 resort, but I definitely felt I got my \"points\" worth from my DVC membership.

We didn't try the two main restaurants as my son is very picky & probably wouldn't have liked the African food served there - but we went to the Mara daily and it was better than average for what they had available (and we NEVER waited in long lines). The bus rides were not that long even to the Magic Kingdom - only approximately 17 minutes. My biggest complaint - the extremely rude - other tourists. I have never been to Disney and experienced such complete and total disregard/disrespect for other people as I did on this most recent trip.

One review stated it took 45 minutes to get to Downtown Disney. Of the four total weeks we had stayed at this property, it never took more than 15 minutes. Folks, it's only about 5 miles away. One of the biggest complaints about the buses is how long it takes to get anywhere. I will say it is not the closest hotel to the Magic Kingdom but what others fail to mention is that because the hotel is somewhat secluded, you don't have to share the bus with other hotels. The AKL buses only make one stop. Your destination. After a long day and tired kids, how would you like to make two stops at other hotels before getting to yours? By the way, did I mention the buses are FREE? Honestly folks, the bus system for the AKL is beyond excellent for the price. The only other knock on the hotel would be the room size for the price. It is on the smaller size for the price but we still find it well worth it. If I had strollers and/or a crib in the room, I would say the rooms are very small.

It's designed to look like a \"watering hole\" so it's zero entry & just fun. While there my kids made bead neckklaces, t-shirts, windchimes, and did the animal tracking. I was able to enjoy the poolside and indoor bar for some tasty cocktails. Boma and Jiko the 2 onsite restraunts, are just awesome. Jiko is probably now my very favorite place to eat in all of Disney and Boma has the best breakfast buffet I've ever had. The staff was wonderful and friendly. I don't think I walked past a staff member ever who didn't greet me or tell me to have a nice day. If it seems that I am completely in love with this resort, that's because it's true. This was my 14th trip to Disney, and my 10th time staying onsite. I don't think I will ever stay anywhere else again.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chesterfield, UK", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Disney has to offer\u201d", "Author": "piphow", "ReviewID": "UR30732315", "Content": "We decided to stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge on our 2nd trip to Disney as we stayed there on our 1st trip in 2007 and loved it so much.

We ate breakfast at Boma every morning, like our last holiday, didn't have reservations for any morning but never waited more than 15 minutes. The staff at Boma are very pleasant and the food exceptional and very good value for money. My only comment regarding Boma is that their evening buffet does not have enough choice for children. The bedrooms at the lodge are very nicely appointed and quiet, however, are a bit dim in the evening, but this in a way does add to the ambience of the place. My comment regarding the rooms is that they do need to have way more storage space for clothing. Room service was always delivered quickly. Transportation to the parks is by bus and they are very frequent and we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus. I spoke to quite a lot of people at the Lodge who had stayed at other resorts at Disney and they said that Animal Kingdom Lodge was by far the best. I would say that meals at Boma are very good value and the food is plentiful and cooked to a high standard, the Mara food is not to my taste and Jiko is gorgeous.

I can't imagine staying at another property. We had a great view of animals 24 hours a day, the pool is amazing, and the lobby is beautiful. The one thing I would recommend when staying at Disney is renting a car. It saves so much time instead of waiting for buses. This is my first trip driving in which I drove to all the theme parks instead of using Disney transportation. The AKL buses now have to stop at the new vacation club first. I got so used to being the only hotel stop on the buses. Many of the other properties usually share their buses with another hotel or have other stops on the way (ex: Blizzard Beach). Someone had mentioned that staying at a monorail resort would eliminate this wait. Well, it will elminate the wait to the Magic Kingdom, but not to other theme parks, where you will have to stand in line like the other properties. Also, when taking a bus to any theme park, there will always be a walk to the theme park entrance. You can't have buses dropping off people in middle of a crowd trying to enter the park. So, be expected to wait for buses and walk to entrances no matter what property you are staying at. If you plan on eating at any of the Disney dining, definately make reservations far in advance, especially for Boma. Everyone in the staff was very friendly.

All I can say is \"how amazingly cool\" to sit on your (smallish) deck looking out at Zebras and Giraffes, among other animals. The kids couldn't get enough. In another review someone talks about the animals being caged up at night. I am not sure what they're talking about because I saw them every time I looked out. There are some berms constructed, I presume to allow the animals some down-time... maybe some of them were asleep back there for that person. But I can promise you that I saw no less than 6 exotic animals each time I looked out. The staff there is over-the-top wonderful. No one does customer service better than Disney. We didn't have dining reservations when we arrived and the Concierge worked very hard to get us some great reservations... he was 50/50 successful, but that's certainly more than what I would have expected in a busy weekend. There are several places to eat. The two best restaurants are incredibly great. Jiko is the nicest tableside service restaurant there. I'd say my meal quality was comparable to the top 20% of restaurants. The wine list focuses on Africa, mostly South Africa. I'm comfortable with \"traditional\" fine dining wine lists but am completely unfamiliar with South African wines. The waiter was rather knowledgeable regarding the wines and we had a very pleasant discussion about our likes and dislikes in various, more familiar, wines and he brought us a mid-range bottle that fit our tastes to a T. There are plenty of kids there and it's one of the first times I've felt comfortable having a great meal with my kids eating plain kid food. Boma is a buffet. In my mind, buffet = bland food, overcooked, and people confusing quantity with quality. Oh, how wrong was I. Absolutely delicious! The food had a variety of flavor and spices like I've never seen in a buffet. The quality of the food was top notch. There were several selections of meats, vegetables, breads, salads, and soups, and desserts. The wine list is similar (identical?) to Jiko. The service was excellent. It was a little pricey, but totally worth it for breakfast and dinner. The only 2 complaints/cautions I have are this: 1) They recently opened up the Kidanni lodge and bus service to/from the various parks stops there first. The signage and announcements aren't up to snuff yet. Hopefully WDW addresses this soon. 2) Some of the hallways are exceptionally long. We were in one of the end rooms, which was great because you were able to see 2 different savannas (and 2 different sets of animals). But if you have difficulty walking distances, then you might want to request a room close to the front desk. Yes, the rooms are a little small-ish given what you pay, but they are comparably sized to the Polynesian for the same level of room.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples", "Title": "\u201cSpoiled our \"Fun Weekend Getaway\"\u201d", "Author": "TravelingAnnNaples", "ReviewID": "UR30292669", "Content": "My husband and I travel frequently and we choose to pay for the comfort and amenities of a 4 to 5 star resort.

The room was dirty and we discovered cleaned drinking glass, had someone's cigarette ashes stuck to the bottom of it. Apparently it was used as an ashtray. The worst disappointment was that we were unable to have dinner on the first evening or any other evening at the Boma restaurant. We settled in our room by 5:30 PM and called down to Boma, but all we got is a recording that they are not taking reservations. At 6:00 PM we went down to Boma and when I said to the Host - \"Two for Dinner\", he asked if I had reservations and I said \"No, I couldn't get through but I'd like to make reservation for this evening\" he replied with a very sarcastic smile and said, \"Nope, we're not taking reservations and you're not eating here tonight\". We were surprised with his attitude. Apparently the resort is so busy that customer courtesy goes out the window. We were too mad to order room service.

There are two resorts at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The only thing about it that I did not like is that you have to take a bus to get to the parks because it is the farthest away from them. It took about 20 to 25 minutes on the bus to get to Magic Kingdom. The bus does not drop you off near the park entrance so you have to be prepared to walk a lot to get to the main entrance. We will be going again soon but I would recommend staying at a resort that has the monorail so that you don't have to do as much walking before you get in the parks. We spent most of our time traveling by Disney bus to get to our destinations which sucked up most of our fun time in the parks. Another thing that will save time if you have small kids.....bring your own stroller. When you get off the bus if you don't have a stroller you will have to carry your child to the main entrance of the park so that you can rent a stroller. Also you must park your stroller at designated areas in the park or the park staff will take them. There is no stroller parking areas near all the rides so most of the time you are dropping off your child with family and one parent is searching for a stroller parking area. To me they should have a stroller parking area near every ride. So my opinion is that the Animal Kingdom Lodge is nice but not close enough to the parks. We were so tired of waiting in lines for buses and then walking so far from the bus drop off areas to the main entrance of the parks. Stay at a resort that has monorail access. It is more money but very much worth it. Also, purchase the Deluxe Dining Plan. You can make reservations ahead of time to eat at all the popular Disney resteraunts.

We were now exhausted after traveling all day, so we went to pull back the covers on the bed where my 5 year old daughter was to sleep and there was somebody else's black thick back hair (I'm assuming) that was 1/2 way down the bed. I took a picture of it...but I will spare you that. I called housekeeping, and the housekeeping manager did call to apologize...and assured me that there wouldn't be any more issues...but we waited another 25minutes (now 11pm) for a sheet change. When the woman arrived she just seemed annoyed. In the other bed there was some crumbs in it--again not ours b/c we just checked in. The sheets were changed finally and we went to sleep.

When we returned the same crumbs were in the bed...I mean I guess at least I knew they were hers...but confused why the sheets weren't changed. But on top of that our bathroom sink and mirror area hadn't been cleaned. The same soap and conditioner that was spilled on the counter tops was still there. The same glasses that we had used to rinse our mouths out with and had toothpaste marks were still there. The iron that was still too hot to put away when we left was in the middle of the floor,and the mirror was dusty. I contacted housekeeping for a sheet change for both beds since it was evident that neither had been changed...trust me...and then I was informed by housekeeping management that they only change the sheets every 3rd day....okay what??? But shouldn't better judgment prevail when the sheets are dirty???? I then requested to be put down for a daily sheet change...and he said of course no problem.

We absolutely enjoyed the hotel. Because we were club level we had a savanna view room on the fourth floor. Everyone was very friendly. I would have given the service a very good if our housekeeper had not been so stingy with shampoo and lotion. I had to request more twice. Other than that annoyance the service was very good. We had a long walk from the lobby to our room but we had a good location on the savanna and were close to the pool and restaurants. The hotel is gorgeous. There is so much detail involved in the hotel design. I enjoyed just walking around looking at the art and fixtures. Words really cannot capture how beautiful it is. We took advantage of many of the hotel's activities - especially the \"bead\" activities geared toward kids. They offer a lesson about flamingos and pelicans, animal tracking, and habitats and one with various mucial instruments. Our daughter liked doing them and getting a bead at the completion of them. She enjoyed getting her face painted with an African design and of course seeing all the animals. Besides taking advantage of the activities we dined at all three restaurants at the hotel, used the pool and its slide, played in the arcade, shopped in the gift shop, went to the club level lounge daily and had our child go to Simba's Clubhouse (the kid center) one evening while we dined. We also used both resort buses and drove. The room was well-appointed. Very pretty but not huge. It was fine for us because we have one child and we not in the room a lot but if you have 2 kids esp teen-aged it could feel a bit tight. The room had teh 2 queen beds, table and 2 chairs, dresser with large flat screen TV, closet, ipod dock, safe, small frig, coffee pot, double sinks and of course the balcony. We rarely heard any noise except when extreme (example - baby next door screamed for a few minutes our first evening and we could hear it but not as if in the room). The beds are very high but I think they provided guard rails for kids because I saw something in the closet which looked like those. Our daughter althou just 5 did not need them. We really found the beds comfortable. In fact we tried to find out what they were. If I could change anything besides size about the room I would add another towel bar somewhere because the rack by the tub and the one outside my the sinks is not enough. I would also increase teh wattage of the lighting in the tub part of the bathroom. Just too dim. Before going I read the lighting in the room was inadequate and I disagree. The lighting in the room is fine with the exception of the tub room and the entry way light of the room. The pool was great. Don't think it is dirty when you see it. It is very clean but the bottom was painted greys and browns to resemble a watering hole in Africa and fir with the theme. Plenty of chairs and towels. The pool was cool not cold and so refreshing given the warm/hot days we had. The pool slide is not as good as the one at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort but still a good slide for the kids. The pool has a zero entry and gets no deeper than say 4.5 ft about. We liked the drinks from the pool bar esp the pina colava. The restaurants: Mara offers counter service. We mostly bought snacks, ice cream, kids pizza and burgers there. All were good and the prices were reasonabel for a resort. We ate at the buffet Boma for dinner one night. I really liked it for all the different foods they offered. My husband prefers more meat and potatos so it did not fly his kite by he found plenty to eat. The soups were really good as well as the salads. I read breakfast is wonderful but since we'd eaten so much this vacation and continentla breakfast was provided as part of the club level we decided to skip it. My DH and I also dined at Jiko. We shared the briout and filet mignon. Both were excellent. The service was wonderful and the restaurant design beautiful. Our DD went to the Simba Clubhouse that night. She had a good time and even asked to go back. We used the bus service offered to go to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. It works well and was great because no other stops - just direct to the parks. We also rode to the parks since we had a car. I prefer that method only because I hate waiting at all for buses. But the bus worked for those days we really needed it. We liked the location of AKL - did not think it seemed too far away. We visited the Grand Floridian, Contemporary and Polynesian while at WDW and were so glad we chose AKL. We also stayed at the Coronado Springs Resort for 4 nights which we very much enjoyed too. The expereince was very different but equally enjoyable. We think we made 2 great picks for our stay at WDW. AKL's Club level was super too. I rated the value as very good because we got a great deal with recent promotions. I would not have paid rack rate but having said that I cannot imagine paying rack rate for any hotel. The club level was really worth it. We stocked up on fruit and sodas as weel has had our breakfast, evening appetizers and sometimes our dessrt there. One night we skipped dinner althogether and just foraged at the lounge. The club lounge had some great fruit in the am plus cereals, breads, juices, coffee and espressos. I liked the afternoon snacks esp the cookies and spiced nuts. The 5-7p offerings were good too - both hot and cold offerings from Boma as well as cheeses, fruit, African wines, beer, sodas and an African smoothie drink. The desserts from 8-10pm were a nice touch too with several liquers provided and coffee. I loved waking up each morning and sitting out on the balconey watching the animals. We were on the Zebra trail/Arusha savanna. We had zebra, giraffe, roan antelope, ankole cattle, crested cranes, guinea fowl, blesbok, kuda and eland out our window. I enjoyed all the sounds of the night and even the guniea fowls' calls in the morning. I also spent sunset on the balconey a number of evenings too.

They may not have had the main savanna view but they still got to see animals in the grassland behind them (including giraffe). so that was a real bonus. The theming is overwhelming when you firat walk through the doors. People \"welome\" you \"home\" as you walk in and the sheer size and detail of the lobby are amazing. Check in was swift and painless. First impressions of the room were very good. Some of the other deluxe hotels have bigger rooms, there is no denying that, but it was plenty big enough. The bathroom is a little small but more than acceptable and clean. A mini bar would have been good too but you can buy alcohol in the shop or Mara and put it in the fridge. It probably saved us money! We ate in all 3 restaurants. Jiko is beautiful...try the coffee rubbed beef short rib...it's divine, as were the pulled beef naans. Boma offers a fantastic biffuet for breakfast and dinner. Don't miss it. The Mara serves basic food when you are on the go, but it is fine.

It's barely noticeable the majority of time and surely you wouldn't expect to smell sweet frangrances while watching a whole variety of animals!

For the extra cost for the Villas, I didn't want anyone being on a pull out couch so I asked to be moved to the lodge (which is just a few floors below) so we could have 2 queens (as I had requested at booking). They accommodated us and refunded the difference. I also had dropped my credit card on the floor and the concierge was very accommodating in helping me by giving me access to a computer so I could check to see that no unauthorized activity occurred. Luckily, a guest picked it up and returned it to the concierge (no harm done). I couldn't thank them enough for helping me during the time my card was lost. A few negatives. There was a fellow at the concierge desk who was not all that accommodating when I was trying to straighten out the room issue (not the same people that helped me with the credit card debacle). He lacked the friendly demeanor that all other staff had and wasn't all that helpful. The beds are comfortable but not the best. I've had more comfortable beds in the newer Hampton Inns so I was a little disappointed in this area. Also, the buses don't come all that often so give plenty of time if you have to make a dinner engagement. If I did it again (and I would), I wouldn't bother with the Villas since for the extra $ all we would have got was a small microwave (which can be requested) and a sink (other than the bathroom sink). The room was essentially the same size as in the lodge.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "HINESVILLE, GA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Time at the Animal Kingdom Lodge!!!\u201d", "Author": "GASOCCERMOM", "ReviewID": "UR28690168", "Content": "My family & I recently stayed at AKL from Apr 11-Apr 17. This was our first trip to WDW, and we were very hesitant at first of our choice to stay at AKL (based on some reviews). I must say we were pleasantly surprised! The lodge was absolutely beautiful! The rooms, although a little small, were very clean and comforatable for a family of four (2 adults, a 10 yr old & a 4 yr old). You really aren't in the rooms that much to be concerned about space. My kids enjoyed waking up in the morning and sitting on the balcony to watch the many animals that grazed nearby. There are numerous activities at the lodge that are planned through out the day for the kids to do. Most people arent at the lodge during the day and miss them. If you plan to have a leisure day and not do the parks, check into the activities. There is a childrens' parade in the evenings where they get to play African instruments and march around the hotel. I absolutely reccomend this for the kids, just to see the smiles on their faces as they play, march, and chant along with the guide! The pool is great! The restaurants are very good, too. Definite reservations needed for dinner at Bomas, however for their breakfast, we were able to walk right up and be seated within 5 minutes. Mara is your quick service restaurant with (depending on the time of day) items like mickey waffles, eggs, burgers, african stew, pita's, chicken sandwiches, salads...all very good. The AKL staff was always very helpful, and answered any questions that we had. The buses ran every 15 minutes to the parks, and made no other stops at other resorts, which was nice. Yes, AKL is the farthest away, but after walking all day, we enjoyed the 15 minute ride!! The only thing that some may not like is that there is no *free* wi-fi access in the rooms. In order to have internet access (if you brought your laptop) was to pay $9.95 per 24 hour access. What we chose to do was pay for one 24 hour period during the middle of our trip so that we could email family and friends with some pictures. FYI...there is a room to the left of the front desk that has a computer that can be used free of charge with internet access and a printer. There is only one, but it is available if needed.

It felt like we were in a cave. The rooms were very small. We had 1 queen and 1 set of bunk beds for 3 people. I can't imaging having 4 people in that room. We were already tripping over each other. The quick-service restaurant, The Mara, had sticky floors, dirty tables and chairs, slow service and cold, unappealing food. The full service buffet restaurant was average. Some raved hot, basic food seems like a baseline expectation vs. something with which to be impressed. Room service never answered our call, and it was during an off-peak time. Could they have been severly understaffed? The service was exceptionally poor. For example, we called the bell service to see if our bags had arrived. They said no, but when my husband went down to the lobby he found them sitting there. At one point we were misinformed by one of the staff members. When we called the error to their attention it was if they couldn't have cared less. We did appreciate seeing animals from our room - daily views of giraffes, birds, etc. We also liked the pool area. It was fairly small but had zero entry, which our daughter loved. Because this was a deluxe resort with a deluxe price, we expected deluxe service, food and amenities.

The Disney Magical Express, from the airport to the hotel was excellent, because once we checked out luggage in at the airport, we never had to worry about it again until we got to our rooms, some 5 or 6 hours later! The \"keys to the world\" are an excellent idea, because you only had to worry about carrying one thing, that allowed you to do everything, from getting into your room, to getting into the parks, to getting meals! I remember when i came on a school trip several years before, you had to worry about a room key, a park ticket and a separate ticket for meals.... The lobby to the AKL was amazing, and the staff were excellent. I didn't get a chance to go to the observation decks to view the animals, and our room wasn't located where we could see them from our balcony. The ambience of the entire site was great.

We also did the only check in 10 days before our trip and that was great as well. We arrived at the hotel at 10am so I was sure that our room would not be ready but to our surprise our room was ready and just what we had asked for. From my reseach I was told the best rooms are pool rooms because they are closest to everything. That was right on the mark, we loved the animals but could see them whenever we wanted and truely we were never in the room except to change and sleep ( great beds). The pool was a dream, it was a busy week but I never felt the pool was too crowded because it was so big. The water slide was just right for our girls and they loved it. Every afternoon we would come back from the park just in time to do the crafts and hang out at the pool. There is also an arcade that is right next to the pool so they could play with there arcade card which they load with cash and use. We also bought the cups so the girls could get free refills on drinks from Mara which they loved. We had dinner at the Boma and really was not impressed. I think the issue was our server...he was just not interested in providing any help and you really need to understand what the food is you are getting ready to eat. He just wanted us in and out. Breakfast was a totally different story, our sever was great explained everything and because it was our daughers birthday he brought out a birthday dessert! The bus serves was not as others have reported. Yes you do have to wait for the bus but not anymore than at other resorts and the time it takes to get to and from the parks is about 5-10 minutes longer but for us it was not that big a deal.

I really do not have any negative comments to make about the trip. We had a great time but since it was our first time, I would definitely do a few things differently next time around. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are absolutely spectacular. We opted for the Savannha-view room and the Park Hopper option with the Disney Deluxe Dining plan. The room was a bit far way from the lobby but was clean and well-stocked with towels and shampoo, etc. We honestly spent very little time in our hotel room so we didn't spend much time watching animals from our hotel room. While it was pretty cool - there are plenty of other places to view the animals from public spaces so if you are looking to save a few dollars you can certainly opt for a standard room. My parents also stayed in the Animal Kingdom with us. I had no problem with our reservations. I called Guest Services and provided both reservations numbers and requested adjoining rooms or rooms in close proximity to each other. Although the rooms were not adjoining, they were right next to each other so I have no complaints about that. I am very happy that I chose the Park Hopper option as we returned to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom multiple times during our stay - I couldn't imagine having to tell my son that we couldn't go back to a particular park to ride his favorite again. The Deluxe Dining Plan was also a good choice - we used all of our meals but did have a number of snacks left over. The Dining plan is very convenient because you've already paid for your meals and just present your Key to the World whenever you purchase a meal or snack. Only one person in your party needs to present the card as they are all linked. With respect to dining, I would definitely make all my reservations well in advance. I only made one character breakfast reservation in advance so we did have to make some concessions with respect to our restaurant options. Jiko is a Signature Dining Restaurant. Our meal was nice and they had a great selection of wines. We only had breakfast at Boma but it too was very nice. The breakfast buffet had some unusual choices but had the old standards as well so it was not difficult to find something a 5-yr old will eat. We had one meal at The Mara which was ok. It's a bit like a cafeteria so it is not a place I would choose to eat all my meals but it's fine for a snack or quick bite by the pool. Definitely plan your days and make breakfast and dinner reservations well in advance. Lunch was spent in the parks and we just grabbed a quick service meal so we could minimize our meal time and maximize our fun time. The one time we did go to the pool, it was closed for maintenance. I'm still not sure what that was all about because we really didn't get any information from the pool staff about when it would open - they would only tell us that it would open when their boss gave them the go-ahead. Just when I was about to go back to our room, they opened the pool. The resort is the farthest from all the theme parks so allow extra time to reach your destination especially if you have dinner reservations. One evening, we had made plans to have dinner at Magic Kingdom and waited at least 30 minutes for a bus at which point most of the other people on the bus were already late for their dinner reservations.

We paid for a savanna view room and we were given room 4309 which has a great view of the main savanna. We did book a room with a queen bed and bunk beds but were given a room with two queen beds. It wasn't a huge deal but we also had to call and remind the front desk that we had requested bed rails and a pack and play also. As it turns out, most rooms have a pack and play in the closet but they sent someone quickly to install the requested bed rails. Our room was on the fourth floor; the lobby and hotel entrance are on the third floor so we had to walk a little ways and then take an elevator up to our floor and walk a little more. I would recommend requesting a third floor room - no elevator ride required and a great height for viewing the animals (if you get the savanna view room.) The room was small but I think it's b/c they give you a balcony which a lot of hotel rooms do not have so you have to deal with that sacrifice. There isn't a lot of storage besides the closet so you will have to adjust accordingly. I've heard others complaining that the rooms were a bit on the dark side. There were five lamps inside our room that made it plenty bright if you chose to have them all on at the same time. The bathroom was well lit and the room also had a ceiling fan which was a nice touch. The Boma restaurant was very busy the night we visited. We had made prior reservations which I highly recommend because it was very busy as soon as it opened at 4:30. Our reservations were at 5:10 and were seated right as we checked in. The food was quite varied in options and everything I tried was tasty. I highly recommend the spiced rotisserie chicken. Our server was great about our children's needs and requests and also about replenishing drinks and clearing dirty plates and utensils. We did not visit the more upscale Jiko during our visit but it looked lovely from the outside. The menu was a bit more \"acquired taste\" than Boma and even though Jiko appeared to offer a kid's menu, I would not feel comfortable taking children into Jiko's white tablecloth atmosphere. We also used room service for breakfast and dinner and they were both delivered with quick, gracious service. The pool was decent sized with a water slide. lifeguards and private hot tubs hidden around the perimeter. The water isn't a typical chlorinated pool, it looks like clear river water. I'm sure it was to coordinate with the outdoorsy/nature feel of the resort. There is also a nice playground area just off the pool which was a nice touch. The playground also served as a convenient place for parents to let their kids burn off energy while waiting to be called for their dinner seating at Boma or Jiko. Even if you don't have a savanna view room, there are a few animal viewing spots around the resort. Check your resort map for locations. I would highly recommend asking when feeding times are during the day because that seems to bring out the animals in droves. It was awesome to watch giraffes, zebras, and antelope run and eat just fifteen or twenty feet away. We had rented a car so we did not use the bus transportation service but there always seemed to be buses coming and going so I doubt the wait was ever very long. We also utilized a grocery delivery service called the Garden Grocer. I highly recommend their service if you want to pay for the convenience of not having to stop at a grocery store to stock up on your needs. They even have baby staples like formula, baby food and diapers. Our delivery came right to the hotel bell service before we even checked in and all our items had been stored perfectly (some needed to be refrigerated) and they were brought to us once we were in our room. Overall, I loved the Animal Kingdom Lodge - the service was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Even the lobby looks like a large living room. The little extra touches like towel animals and turn down service makes you feel like you are special. You do pay for all of this of course, it is Disney after all.

I had heard and read so many wonderful things about this property, I was eager to experience it with my young (animal loving) children and was sorely disappointed. We choose this hotel over all the other more expensive Disney properties because our young sons LOVE wild animals and they too were very sad with our experience. Our arrival was great, with a personal guide to our small one bedroom suite. Our conceive assured us we would see lots of animals grazing and roaming in the yards. We did see a few very distant cattle the first night and saw NOTHING for the remainder of our five day trip. Other than our initial greeter, the staff was hard to communicate with and even at one point very rude. There is an \"Animal Information\" button on the phone, when my inquisitive seven year old called down to ask questions about the animals the \"animal expert\" told him he was very busy and to stop playing with the phone. It's Disney for Heaven's Sake!! Most of the people using that line will be young people. I considered this behavior unacceptable, rude and very out of line. Our maid service was very shabby, with the staff only doing the bare minimum each day. Never were our towels arranged in characters of anything interesting or out of the ordinary as they have been at other properties. Even when my husband left a detailed note about something, it was completely ignored. The beds were made and new towels given and that is it. Trash was often left and things left in thrown about. The food was also another huge disappointment. It is either very basic kid fare or very heavily influenced African fare for adults. The food itself was not bad but it did get old very quickly. The bottom of the pool is a dirty brown and makes the water look nasty but the pool is open late. No Disney movies in the rooms either, just 17 channels of Disney World property promotions. To top it off, my children left an item on the desk when as we left. We called three times within 24 hours our departure. We never received a call back or any information at all about the item. This property sounds wonderful for children but it is NOT worth the price. We will not stay there again. This property sounds so great for children who love animals but you will be better off going on the Animal Kingdom Safari. I realize the staff cannot control when the animals will appear but since they bill themselves as \"the\" property to see the animals they need to at the very least ,be friendly when the young children ask about them. Good idea but don't expect Wild Kingdom to be in your backyard.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ocean city", "Title": "\u201cAnimal Kingdom Lodge was great!\u201d", "Author": "trashedbunny", "ReviewID": "UR26629649", "Content": "I just returned from a week stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. (March 14-21, 2009). We arrived around noon and check in was quick and easy. Our room had a view of the front of the hotel where the taxi's are parked. The front desk said that the hotel was busy but by Tuesday we could change rooms if we wanted too. We decided to stay where we were. There were plenty of viewing areas to go to if we wanted to see the animals. We had a room with two queen beds. Very nice and clean. There were only two of us so I didn't think the room was too small. We didn't spend too much time at the resort or in our room. I did think that the beds and especially the pillows were very comfortable. After a long day at the parks, the bed was very comfortable. The only thing I could complain about was the remote control of the TV. It didn't work very well. We used one of the hot tubs one night and sat at the pool one day. The pool was heated and actually open 24 hours . We didn't have reservations to get into Boma but we went down 15 minutes before they opened and were at a table within the half hour. So worth it!! The food was wonderful!!! The coconut curry seafood stew was delicious as was the butternut squash soup! The staff was very friendly. We did eat at the quick service place called Mara. The vegetable flat bread was tasty. The night before we left, a sheet of paper was left on our door, explaining what time to come down to the airport desk to get your boarding pass and to get your luggage tagged for the return trip and also what time your bus would take you to the airport. Very easy so you don't have to worry about anything. I would reccomend The Animal Kingdom Lodge but would probably try a different one on a return trip since Disney has so many places to choose from.

We were able to see animals throughout the day and evening, zebras, giraffes, etc. We had a pool view room, as I didn't want to have a parking lot view, but didn't want to pay extra for the savanna view. We didn't get upgraded, as I think the hotel was probably full, but there were lots of areas to view the animals, including one right across from our room that we had all to ourselves whenever we were out there. Our room was right next to the elevator, but was very quiet. The pool was great, with a great slide that my son loved, and the pool area was very nice. We ate at Boma one night, which was really good, and at Mara, which was fine. You can also buy fruit and snacks at Mara to take with you into the parks, which would be a more convenient and healthier option than waiting in a line to eat lunch at the park. The room was big enough, the bathroom clean and nice, with granite countertops in the sink area, and a nice shelf over the sinks to put your stuff. I thought the staff was very pleasant, and there are a lot of activites - at night there was an area where you could watch the animals through night vision goggles - pretty neat. I spent a lot of time deciding where to stay for our trip, and I'm very glad we picked this hotel - we actually would have had fun spending a day away from the parks and just hanging out at the pool, viewing the animals, and having a rest day. I think for the money (we paid $220 through hotels.com) it was worth it to stay on Disney property, close to the parks, and take advantage of the Disney Extra Magic Hours available only to Disney hotel guests - on our day at the Animal Kingdom the park was open 3 hours later, until 8, and around 4 the crowd really thinned out, and we were able to ride all the rides again with no wait at all. We didn't do the Disney Dining plan, but if we go back to Disney I would do it, as I think it is a good deal - the food in the parks is pretty expensive.

Agree the basic room is small, due to two queen beds taking up most of the room. I spoke to a manager about my concerns with the size of the room, and was upgraded to a one bedroom savannah view room at no additional charge. The one bedroom was such a great experience that we took advantage of the offer in our room, to return at 40% off the regular rate, if booked before we checked out. However, we booked a studio due to the high cost of a one bedroom. With the 40% reduction, it works out to a price similar to the buy four nights, get three free. We found the one bedroom was actually quite large for two people.....the hotel premises were extremely clean, and no problems with the lighting or furnishings. I would recommend staying at this resort, to anyone who is thinking of planning a trip to Disneyworld. We had a totally enjoyable and stress free vacation. The meals at Mara were reasonably priced and great tasting. The buffet at Boma was fantastic. The free bus service was a bonus, as we had no long waits (we went to the parks 5 days out of 7); and found it much more convenient, than driving our own vehicle. We also purchased the Dining Plan and my only complaint with it, would be the amount of food we received. The meals were of the highest quality and there were no restrictions. I would have preferred a salad option, to the desserts occasionally, but the desserts were wonderful.

Our flight arrived in the morning and because check-in is at 3pm, we were 'homeless' for a few hours. We were able to keep our luggage locked in Bell Service at the lodge until check-in which allowed us to explore the resort and get some lunch in the meantime. We decided to spend the extra money for a savannah view and when our room was finally ready and we went up to check it out I almost started sobbing. We must have been given the room with the WORST view in the resort!! It was on the savannah SIDE of the hotel, but with a view blocked by a HUGE rock covered in bird poop, a very large steel pole, and some dead plants.....not even sunlight was getting through our doorwall! Now...if you leaned WAAAAAY over the balcony railing you might catch a glimpse of an animal off to the left in the distance but for the price...that was completely unacceptable and I requested a new room. I have to admit that I was extremely angry that they would even attempt to represent that room as a 'savannah view'. For future travellers...it was room #2211. If you are assigned that room at the front desk don't even bother walking all the way there, just hand the key back. Better yet, when booking a savannah view room...tell them you want an 'unobstructed view' since I'm told there are several along that rock formation which share the same shameful view of the rocks. Our new room on the 3rd floor (#3565) had an amazing view and the animals were right there to greet us every time we stepped out onto the balcony. THAT room was well worth the price. Yes, the rooms are small but we did fine with 2 adults and a 7-year-old....(we had 2 queen beds). The TV channels are scarce...mostly Disney promotional programming and a few select news, weather, and Lifetime channels so don't plan on catching many of your favorite shows while you're there. Also, cleaning & towel service is not provided daily. We were given 4 bath towels, 4 wash cloths, & 2 hand towels in the room and those were not replaced until the 4th day so I suggest that if you have more than 2 or 3 people in your group, bring some additional towels...or pay the extra $6 and request early towel service at the resort. The pool is perfect for kids...not too deep and the water is delightfully warm so it worked out well on our cool February evenings. The hotel and grounds are incredibly clean and the staff was friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay....many of them extending extra attention to making my daughter's experience there wonderful. Many, if not most, of the staff are from Africa and are more than happy to share all about their homes and culture! They have crafts and activities all day long for the kids and we participated in many of them. The bus transportation to and from the parks is easy and convenient and we never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride. The Mara quick service restaurant serves good food but pretty much the same thing every day so if you can grab a few meals out at the parks for variety, do it. The travel mugs they provide allow for free refills of soda, coffee, & tea at the resort (not the parks) and is very nice to have since a 20oz bottle of soda would otherwise cost $2.75. NOTE: Bring a little bottle of dishwashing liquid with you so you can wash your mugs up in the room. After a few days, just rinsing with water just doesn't seem CLEAN. Oh! Make sure you take your kids down to the pool area after dark so they can view the animals through night-vision goggles! I gave this resort a rating of 4 instead of 5 because of their misrepresentation of our first 'savannah view' room ...and the lack of basic daily towel service that is offered even in the cheapest motels around the nation.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jandebnan", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience!

This was our first trip to Disney and the Animal Kingdom Lodge. We found it to be a great experience. When we first arrived we were assisted with luggage and check in was really quick. Staff were very pleasant and courteous. Our room was located on the Uzima Savannah with a view of the animals. We had the queen with bunks and the room, although a little small, was very clean and well kept. We had plenty of room for the three of us, though it could be a problem if you have older kids- as far as space. The lighting in the room is low, but the double vanity has bright enough light for make-up needs. The drapes on the balcony window were very thick and enabled one to have a nice dark room if you wanted to sleep late! There is a large flat screen TV with limited channels, but who watched TV on vacation anyway. The temperature in the room was well controlled and comfortable. We saw animals every day we were there. They were so close to our room- our son was absolutely thrilled (we were too)! There was also a variety of animals, not just the same ones all the time. Part of the package was a refillable mug that could be used only in the hotel, but it was great! The Mara (counter service-fast food) was open until 11:30 at night and you had access to all the drinks you wanted (coke products, tea, coffee etc) while in the hotel. The pool was large (though not as large as the picture looks) and there were two hot spas, and a wading pool as well. The whole thing is surrounded by the savannahs and animals of all kinds (none predatory)- zebra, giraffe, impalas, kudu, flamingos, crowned cranes, anoke cattle, antelope, eland, wildebeast, gazelle, ---well, all kinds of animals. (also you see people frequently out cleaning up after them so there are no unplesant smells anywhere!) The walk to the room was a bit of a distance, but the quality of the lodge and the amenities, make it well worth it. It was so quiet! After a long day in the crowds at the parks, it was nice to return to the room and the wonderful silence. There were animal calls at times, but that was nice to hear. There are two \"table service\" resturants in the lodge, the Boma and the Jiko. We did not eat at the Jiko, but the Boma was a wonderful buffet for breakfast and dinner with foods with an African flair! The service was great, but it could be a bit noisy at times. The Mara was the fast-food-snack place, really quick and the food (burgers, sandwiches, cereal, breakfast items-mickey waffles-snacks) was good as well. There are many activities at the hotel for all ages so just check the activity schedule if you plan to stay around the hotel for a day. The bus service to the parks was great. We had virtually no waiting time from the hotel to any of the parks. The lodge is the farthest from the Magic Kingdom, but closest to the Animal Kindgom park so the bus ride to Magic Kingdom is of course about 20 minutes or more. The only wait we had for a bus was returning from EPCOT after fireworks, but it wasn't that bad. We were extremely pleased with the Animal Kingdom Lodge. There is really nothing negative we can say about it. Before this trip I read some negative reviews about it, that there were hardly any animals seen from the savannah view rooms,and dirty rooms, so I was a little concerned, but ours was a wonderful experience.

We were very pleased to have an overall wonderful experience. Our family includes two children, ages just-turned-6 and 3 1/2. We picked up a free birthday buttonfor my daughter at City Hall at Magic Kingdom, and she received birthday wishes and a free goodies all week. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express. As we approached the Magical Express counter at the airport, we were dismayed to see a VERY long, slow-moving line. In Disney's defense, the line was long and slow because most people had forgotten their Magical Express documentation and the Disney reps had to do research and reprint paperwork. I had my documentation, and it took the rep less than 1 minute to scan my booklet and send me to the AKL line. Not having to get our luggage ourselves was worth it!!! The luggage arrived in our room shorlty after we checked in. Once in our bus line, we waited about 10 minutes for the bus to appear and begin loading. There was one other resort on the bus with us, and we were dropped off last. We landed at 9:30 and were at the hotel by 11:30. Our friends who landed after us said they had no wait in the M.E. express line. The hotel is very nice by Disney standards. The grounds are lush and the aesthetics pleasing. From the lobby to the pool area, attention to detail was obvious. Our check in was quick and smooth. The rep was polite and professional. He clearly explained everything we needed to know. We were thrilled that our room was ready and went there immediately to unpack. My friend who lives in Orlando had dropped off some groceries for us at the bell hop station at AKL. She had the Disney cast member's name and a confirmation number. When we stopped by to pick up our packages, there was some confusion and the packages could not be found. We've found, in all our dealings with Disney cast members, that if you ask 3 different people the same question, you generally get 3 different answers. So, we asked another bell hop where our packages were and she found them and had them sent to our room quickly. Everyone with whom we dealt in the bell hop and check-in area was friendly and helpful. Our room was not as small as we had expected after reading the reviews. We had savannah room 3425 on the zebra trail. We liked it b/c it was on the same floor as the lobby and only one building away, so our walk wasn't long at all. There was little noise, even though many people use that hallway. We were never awakened at night by passers-by. Upon entering the room, our kids ran right to the balcony and were excited to see giraffe, zebra, and other animals. They were not at our balcony, so if you expect them to be very close, you might be disappointed. My husband and I decided that we would not pay the extra for the view next time; it was very nice but not exceptional. There were not always animals out and our kids, although they loved it at first, had more fun playing with the hotel phone and fridge. I'm glad we did savannah view this time but would spend that money somewhere else next time. The room was very nice and spotlessly clean and we appreciated the jungle motif. It was an adjoining room, so we parked our stroller in the space by the adjoining door. I saw a room across the hall that was not adjoining, and they had a dresser in that spot. We wish we had an extra dresser, as there was very little storage. We had a t.v. armoire with two small drawers below it and a closet. We could not fit all the clothes for our family of four (with two small children) in the drawers, so more space would have been nice. There was a narrow shelf on the bathroom sink area that was not wide enough to fit my cosmetic bag. Aside from space issues, there were a few more things that made us check \"above average\" instead of \"excellent\" for our stay. We had a great time, but I want to be as thorough as possible, so here are the negatives: -little storage -LG brand t.v. remote didn't work well. A few people we met at the pool complained about the same thing. Trying to change channels was frustrating. -Disney offers very few channels. We were out of the room most of the day, but, for $300+ a night, I expect to be able to find a Law & Order rerun to watch when I'm in bed! Ironically, they offered the TV Japan channel but not USA network!! -We had a passive-aggressive relationship with our maid. There were animal towels left on our bed after the first night there. My kids left a thank you note. No more animal towels. On our 3rd night, I left a nice note asking for animal towels the next day. No animal towels. The maid unplugged our clock, which is not easy to do b/c of its placement, so it was not illuminated. We thought it was broken. We called housekeeping. The guy said to check the plug. My husband and I joked that the maid was trying to irritate us by ignoring our requests or not doing basic things, such as replacing the hotel shampoo. The room was very clean, however, so we didn't complain. These were minor issues that didn't ruin anything for us. We understood, though, how many people complained about housekeeping on tripadvisor. -The beds are VERY high off the ground. If you have young kids, request railings. We called housekeeping, The nice man came and installed us for them. He said he had given out seven that day and we got the last pair. Reserve them early if you need them. I couldn't sleep the first night b/c I thought the kids would roll out of bed. Because it was very cold during the week we were there, only a few brave souls were in the pool. We enjoyed the pool area and its surroundings. We had our pick of chairs, and we appreciated the life vest for the kids. The slide and outdoor bar were great. I'm wondering how noisy it would be for pool-side rooms when it's crowded??? My kids loved the few hotel activities in which they participated: the parade, story telling and night vision binocular viewing. They wanted their caricatures done. The artist is there from about 6-11 or something like that-- evening hours only and late for little kids. We ate dinner at Boma; the buffet was fine and the kids tried some African foods. There was enough to fill us up, but nothing extraordinary. We don't have advanced palates, so maybe a gourmand would love the selection more than we did. We ate at the quick-service Mara restaurant a few times. Breakfast was adequate. We liked the lunch/dinner selections better. Something for everyone. We had the meal plan, which worked really well for us. Be sure to use up all your snacks to get your money's worth. We received a 30-minute game card w/ our package, and the kids liked the arcade. It was family -friendly. I'm a control freak and was concerned about not renting a car and having to use Disney transportation. Mostly the buses ran very smoothly. Once, at AKL, we had to wait 40 minutes for a bus. People were understandably angry. I agree w/ other reviewers-- don't expect to get on the bus first if you're there first. Everyone moves en masse toward the bus doors. I found myself organzing the crowd to ensure the early arrivers got on first. Overall we waited anywhere from 5-15 minutes for buses. Sometimes the ride was pleasant, and sometimes we were packed too tightly-- people standing. With strollers, packages, etc., they needed to run more buses. We used the express check out, which was perfectly smooth. We had no issues. We were spending more time in Florida, so we rented a car from Alamo (they and National rent cars at the Disney car care center) so we didn't use the return to airport service. The car care center requires at least an hour and a half to pick you up after you call, so plan accordingly. Aside from minor negative issues, we really had a great week. I checked out the Wilderness Lodge where our friends stayed, and I preferred AKL. It's a beautiful resort; it's clean; The frenetic pace you'd experience at other resorts is not present here.

Unfortunatley we didn't have a chance to try out the pool because it was so COLD! I found both Mara and Boma surprisingly good ( I am usually not a fan of Disney restaurants) which lots of different food options and something to please everyone. I particularly like the African food options at Boma. What I like most about the hotel was that it had a very calming atmosphere. I was a great place to unwind after a hectic day at the parks. They keep the hotel quite dark (apparently it's for the animals), and that combined with the African vibe was very serene. I think it says something about the hotel when our entire party (6 adults and 3 kids) all loved the hotel.

Travellers were myself, my husband, our 3-year-old son and our 6-year-old daughter. We had a WONDERFUL experience at this hotel. Rooms: the rooms were a fair size. Not as big as the Polynesian (but the rooms there are enormous, so not really a fair comparison). There was plenty of room for the 4 of us. I had booked just a standard view, so we were expecting the parking lot, but upon check-in we were pleasantly surprised with a Savannah room! Across the green space, and beyond all the wonderful animals we got to look at, we could see the construction of the new Disney Vacation Club Villas (which is probably why we got that room). This did not bother us AT ALL. We were never kept awake, and we did know there was construction going on, because we did our homework BEFORE we booked. The room was always clean. The mini refrigerator was nice, although quite loud (don't put items in the door overnight - they tend to rattle). The only real complaint about the room is that the beds were rather uncomfortable. Still, we were so tried at the end of every day it didn't really hinder our sleep at all. All in all, I probably wouldn't pay extra for the Savannah room, as there are so many wonderful animal viewing areas around the hotel. But it was certainly enjoyed by all of us! Housekeeping: wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Our room was SPOTLESS everyday, and we always had plenty of towels and soaps, etc. We left a tip everyday in appreciation of this. We didn't get towel animals everyday, but we knew that wasn't a given, so we weren't terribly disappointed. A word of advice to those complaining about how disappointed your children were - DON'T PROMISE THEM TOWEL ANIMALS! I read a lot of reviews before booking this hotel and MANY of them said no towel animals. So we didn't tell the children there would be any. Problem solved. These housekeepers work hard. They clean a lot of rooms. I'd rather my room be clean with fancy towel art than dirty with towel animals all over the place. And no, no one filled the ice buket for me. I don't think, no matter how much I paid, I have ever stayed in a hotel where housekeeping filled the ice bucket for me. It's not really so hard to do it yourself. Really not hard at all. Buses: never had a problem. Once the Magic Kingdom bus broke down and we had to wait a little longer than usual, but no big deal. It really isn't such a long ride anywhere either. I know other reviewers complained about the long bus rides, and I was prepared for that, but was NOT long at all! I think the longest trip was about 20 minutes, and really, it takes me longer than that to drive my daughter to her ballet class, AND I have to battle rush hour traffic on the way home. So much easier to let someone else handle the driving while I enjoy the scenery. Don't worry about long bus rides. They're not that long and they're really no big deal. We don't ride the bus at home, so my children thought it was really cool! Service: terrific! Everyone we encountered at this hotel was SUPER friendly, and always ready to help out. We wanted for nothing. Restaurants: We were on the Quick-Service Dining plan (which I do recommend!) so we only ate at The Mara. It was good food. Quite a bit of variety, even for the children. We never went hungry, and the staff was SO helpful in deciphering the dining plan. The made sure you got everything you paid for! Pool: LARGE! Lots of room, lots of chairs, and a pretty neat little waterslide. The only problem we had was that the waterslide was one person at a time - NO expceptions, so my 3-year-old didn't get to go on it like he wanted. He was a little scared to go on his own. HOWEVER, it was SO nice to see them enforcing their own pool rules, unlike other vacations we have been on (i.e., Disney cruise line). Other things: the hotel itself is really neat. The decor is beautiful. There's also a playground for the kids if you need something to do. All in all, a great hotel. I would definately stay here again!

There are big differences between the updated rooms and the older wings of the hotel. Although it is a newer disney property - the updated rooms are much nicer. We even tried to upgrade to the concierge level - but it was all sold out. (Definately spend the money to do this if it is available!) But a simple request for an updated room when checking in put us in the perfect room from day one. We had fantastic views of the animals in the morning and late afternoon. There was quite a bit of construction going on at the adjacent villas - but we never lost a wink of sleep from the noise. Good: Animals & updated rooms. All staff with the exception of our room attendant. She was not very friendly and we never got the fun towel animals that everyone else got. My kids were disappointed. After the first day- we never had ice in our bucket. We have been to several of the deluxe resorts - and this one paled in comparasion. Fitness Center: LOVED IT! I worked out here every morning prior to the race. They opened the center early every morning to accomodate the race participants prior to the race. Staff was great and so were the spa treatments. Jiko & Boma : Both EXECELLENT dining experiences! I LOVED the extensive wine selection at Jiko! Golf: After 2pm rates at the golf courses dropped to $70 per round! My husband and I had mid 70's weather and a great time golfing. No issues with getting T times either! They also pay your cab fare to/from the golf courses! Bad: You can hear the start of the circle of life race from your room. No chairs available on nice days at the pool. Pool is very small but well maintained. The pool in the villas area will be a nice compliment when it is finished. Bus transportation everywhere. We were actually passed by twice (different times) at the ticket and transportation center. You can't take advange of all of the concierge perks even if they are sold out. Ugly: The older rooms in the resort. A little dusty and in need of updates (we saw a friend's room). Don't book a breakfast at 1500 Park Fare before 9am! There is no way to get there via Disney Transportation and it costs $25 for a cab ride! I was exceptionally disappointed! Disney gives you a cab voucher for $70 round of golf - but not for a $150 breakfast! Go figure! The adjacent construction. Goofy Challenge .... My family and I stayed here for the marathon weekend. Disney did a great job with transportation to/from the expo and marathon start. We did have tons of people who were not runners getting on the buses as early as 4 am. It was difficult to weigh the late hours in the parks with my family against getting up at 3:30 am two mornings in a row to make sure I get to the start line in time. UUUGGHHH! Boma did offer some snacks for sale as early as 3am - but I didn't venture down there as I have a specific pre-race diet. The shuttles from the marathon to the hotel were equally as pleasant. My family boarded the post race shuttle with me and had received no negative feedback from the other riders or drivers. Everyone was exceptionally nice and very helpful! I book the race retreat - and it wasn't worth the price. The food was nasty and nothing you wanted to eat after a marathon! The only plus was the lack of lines at the porta potty! I tried to get a \"$10\" massage and they only took cash. No credit cards! So I asked the \"concierge\" in the tent to book me a spa appointment back at animal kingdom lodge and after 15 minutes of waiting for her to find the number - I left and used my treo phone to do it in 5 minutes (about the same amount of time it took the shuttle to get me from the tent to the animal kingdom lodge)! I would say skip the massage at the race and go right for the spa at the lodge! The therapist I had was a certified PT and did wonders for my legs. After 39.3 miles she got all of the knots out and left me in a fabulous position to spend the rest of the afternoon at Blizzard Beach and the remainder of the evening in Epot! NO KIDDING! Don't get me wrong - I didn't walk as fast as usual - but I had very little soreness and really enjoyed the remainder of the day with my family!", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cEscape to the Animal Kingdom Lodge\u201d", "Author": "Brav3Heart", "ReviewID": "UR24224899", "Content": "We transferred to the Animal Kingdom Lodge from the Polynesian Resort and stayed for 10 nights. In short it was awesome. We had a Savannah view room on the zebra trail (all the way at the back) and it was (small criticism) quite a hike! (Like I imagine it would be in Africa). The view was breathtaking and especially great as any time my 10 month old daughter was feeling cranky, we'd walk her to the balcony so she could watch the parade of zebras, giraffes, ankole cattle, etc. parading passed our room, which made us happy too! Finding the room was a lot easier than at the polynesian and slightly smaller but that's where the comparison ends as they are 2 different resorts. The lobby is a sight to see as well as the entire resort (by that I mean where there are animal viewing spots (pretty much everywhere). Check in was a breeze - could've just been due to the fact we spent the day at cape canaveral and checked in at around 6 in the evening. All the staff were friendly and greeted as we walked by. The room wasn't huge but big enough for the 3 of us but even if we had 2 fully grown children with us I think it would still have been big enough to be comfortable. Again the towel animal on welcome was a great touch and housekeeping did a great job in maintaining the room as well as creating a new towel animal each day. The only complaint I have with housekeeping was that we had bathers hanging on the line in the shower in the morning but upon returning in the evening they were gone. Can only summise that they must have fallen down and were mistakenly taken down to the laundry with the towels. Not a huge deal but couldn't go back out to the pool the next day as we wanted. Climate control in the room is good, but needs an on/off switch - my wife and daughter had developed a cold and trying to get the temperature right was too hard. Easily overcome with a call to housekeeping who turned it off for us but if we wanted to turn it back on, we would have had to call again (luckily we didn't need to). Bathroom was a little small as the toilet right in between the door and the bath made it seem a little crowded. (Again not a huge deal). The pool wasn't huge but not small either. My daughter enjoyed it and if she were tall enough would have enjoyed the slide too! She really enjoyed the playground next to where the pink flamingos gather as if she got tired she could look at the birds for a while and then go back and play. No shortage of viewing areas all around the resort during the day but the night viewing while enjoyable can prove frustrating when standing in a queue for a short glimpse through the nightvision. Only dined at 2 of the 3 restaurants on offer, Mara which is really convenient and cheapest of the 3 and Boma (which I think is the buffet one). Buffet's not really to my liking but even I enjoyed this restaurant. Buses around disney were never a problem and never waited more than 20 mins for one to arrive to take us where we wanted to go. The rides can take a long time though to the magic kingdom and downtown disney. The other's aren't too far away. Checkout was easy due to the convenience of express checkout and magical express made it even easier to get to the airport. If flying domestically, I recommend using the resort airline check-in as it takes away the hustle and bustle of putting up with the long queues at the airport. Overall it was a great experience and would stay there again, just so I could see my daughter's reaction every time she saw the animals go by. Worth the price?

The first 2 weeks were in a Pool View room, and the last 4 nights in a club level room. We arrived quite late in the evening and check in was quick and efficient. I loved the decor of the hotel common areas and our room. The lobby is truly breathtaking, and our room was clean, reasonably spacious and decorated in keeping with the african theme. The only criticism I have of the room is that although it faced the pool, the view was incredibly limited due to the tree right in front of our balcony. We ate at The Mara a few times which was a good quick service option, and Boma and Jiko both of which were excellent. Boma was loud and crowded, but we enjoyed the food selections, whereas Jiko had a much quieter atmosphere, fantastic food and service. We also ordered room service a couple of times, and it was always good, with big portions and delivered quickly. The bus transportation to the parks was excellent with only one unacceptable wait in over two weeks. After 2 weeks here, we re-checked in for our club level reservation. We were escorted up to the lounge for a private check in, which was very pleasant and were told our rooms would be ready by 3. One of the draws of a club level stay was the savannah view, and when we got into our room I was incredibly disappointed to see construction (painting and sawing) going on right outside of our balcony, effectively making the balcony (and thus the savannah view) unusable. Our complaint was dealt with quickly and we were moved to a room not affected by the construction, but I felt the hotel staff should have informed us of the construction while checking in. After this inital disruption we had a great view of the savannah, and watched zebra and giraffe from our balcony. The offerings in the concierge lounge were very good, and we also took part in the sunrise safari which was a fantastic experience and one of the highlights of our holiday.

We had a wonderful time.ROOM: We booked a standard room, but were upgraded to a Pool View, and it was beautiful. Our balcony overlooked the pool, and the smell of incense burning fills the air. I really thought I'd be disappointed not having a Savannah view, but was not. There are so many viewing spots to watch the animals, so in my opinion to pay for the Savannah view isn't worth it. We saw giraffe, zebra, and much more. We couldn't hear anything from the rooms around us. Our room was newly renovated and had some upgrades, like a flat screen TV. There are two dressers,and a large closet. As for the room size, it isn't huge, but we were comfortable. It was my husband, myself, and our three children: ages 12, 3, and 18mnths. POOL: The pool is heated, and we were able to enjoy it even with the cold temps Orlando was having that week. The hot tub was great also, and both were open 24 hrs. They have life vests for the kids right where you get your towels. The kiddie pool is a little secluded, and we didn't see it right away. It was great for our 18 mnth old, however the bottom is very rough. There is so much to hold the children's interest, like the game room, looking at the animals, the pool and the playground. They even have face painting for the kids, and they do scheduled arts and crafts. My 3 year old loved making wooden animals. In the evenings, they have the children play with musical instruments (drums and such) and they listened to a woman educate them about African culture and then danced around the hotel lobby playing their instruments. VERY CUTE! The hotel is large, so yes there is a lot of walking. But, after the meals you will eat at Disney, the walking won't hurt! I read some negatives about hotel staff, but we had all positive experiences with staff, from maids to hotel desk, and even cashiers in the food court. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. The lobby is gorgeous, and you just have to look around. There is a firepit inside, as well as one outside. FOOD: The restaurant, Boma was great.It's a buffet with many African dishes as well as chicken and macaroni and cheese for the kids. Jiko's looked amazing, however with two toddlers, we never had a chance to dine there. Its not a \"kid place\". We were on Disney's dining plan, and let me say its well worth it! We had 4 people eating,and our youngest eating off our plates. Our average bill was $90-$100. I definitely recommend the dining plan. The only thing not included is tips. Make reservations for all your sit-down dinners, because they book up. Ohana's at the Polynesian is outstanding, and Yik & Yaks at Animal Kingdom. Hollywood Studios has a (Fifties Diner) not sure of name, that is great for families, and they have great malts. The MARA, at AKL is very convenient, you can dine in or outside, or at times we took our tray back to room because the kids were tired. Its cafeteria style. The (dessert) Zebra Domes are delicious. The African stew and flat bread chicken pizza is great. PARKS: We saw the finale show of the American Idol experience and it was just like being at the show. Everyone enjoyed that. TRANSPORTATION: The buses were ok. Wait time wasn't too bad, however stand near curb because people will come at last minute,and walk right up, as there is no real order to waiting for bus.They fill up pretty quick. However leaving parks, there are lines for waiting for the bus. The gift shop at the AKL is great, with many authentic items. There is some construction going on, but it didn't affect us.

We didn't have to wait around at baggage claim after our flight. We just boarded our Magical Express bus and we were on our way. Our bags were taken to our Hotel and we were told that our bags would be delivered to our room upon our arrival, which they were with no problems. We ended up renting a car our second day which gave us a little more freedom rather than relying on Disney transportation from the AKL to the different Disney Parks. We noticed quite a long wait (approx 20 \u2013 40 minutes) going from the AKL to the parks. AKL is the furthest resort from the parks. I booked a Kilimanjaro Club Level room as a surprise for my new bride. We were told that a Concierge Cast member would be available to meet us at the Concierge Kiosk in valet once we arrived. We arrived at the AKL approx 1100am and no one was available to meet us at the kiosk. I was told that a Club level cast member would be down to assist us within a few minutes. I waited approx 20 minutes and was escorted up to the club level (6th floor) by a valet cast member...again there were no club level cast members available to assist us. The Kilimanjaro Club was very nice and very crowded. My wife and I decided to grab a quick snack (fruit and water) and wait for a concierge cast member to check us in. There were only two cast members assisting other guests. After waiting approx 90 minutes (we were a little upset at this point) we were assisted by cast member Jack. Jack was extremely apologetic and offered to get us a private car for our trip that was planned to DTD later in the week. I appreciated him doing that and before we left the concierge lounge he gave us some tips on the AKL signature restaurant (Jiko) and we were then on our way to our room. Our room was a Savannah view room overlooking the Arusha Savannah. We had a Giraffe and several Zebras just off of our balcony and they were frequent visitors throughout our stay. The other animals along our trail seemed to stay more to the back of our Savannah and out of view. The beds in our room had been made, but the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. We called and spoke to housekeeping and they said someone would be right up to clean the bathroom. Approx 5 minutes later a Housekeeping Manager was at our door with a housekeeping cast member and she (Manager) asked to see the bathroom. She was very apologetic and gave us her business card and told us to call her if we needed anything during our stay. After a few hours of rest, we decided to take a stroll around the AKL and check out the different guest areas and dining options. The main pool looked very comfortable and relaxing. The firepit outside the main lobby was great. It was very romantic and the storytelling by AKL cast members was great. These \"storytellers\" were from Africa and it was great to hear stories about their life while growing up in Africa. We decided to take the advice of Jack and try out Jiko. Jiko is an amazing restaurant with a beautiful decor and wonderful food. Jack had recommended the Filet Mignon on top of Mac and Cheese. Wow!!!! The meat was very good and seasoned just right and this wasn't your every day Kraft Mac n Cheese. My Wife ordered the Scallops and she kept raving about how good the food was. After Dinner we decided to check out the Savannah with night vision binoculars that were available at a viewing station near the main pool. That was awesome and we were able to see many animals on the savannah. When we arrived back at our room we were shocked to see Chocolate covered strawberries had been delivered to our room. It was such a beautiful display with the chocolate elephant and AKL sign that was also in chocolate. The strawberries were also very good. I wasn't sure if this was because it was our honeymoon and housekeeping's way of apologizing for the bathroom not being cleaned. A great surprise none the less. A benefit of booking a club level room was the opportunity to take a morning Safari. We got up early on Thursday morning and proceeded to the Concierge lounge for our breakfast safari (approx $55 per person) check in. It was very cold at 645am and my wife and I were given blankets (that had to be returned) for our Safari. We were taken by bus (50 people/2 buses) to the Animal Kingdom Park where we boarded the Kilimanjaro Safari attraction. Our guide throughout the morning was cast member Greg (AKL Curator for animals) and he was extremely knowledgeable regarding all the animals. The Safari Attraction normally lasts approx 15 minutes when taken as a park guest with no stopping on along the way, however the breakfast Safari was approx 1 hour with many stops along the way throughout the Savannah's. My wife and I were able to get many pictures. After the Safari was over, we were escorted to Pizzafari for a buffet breakfast prepared special for our safari group. The food was very good and since this was our honeymoon...we were given special attention from the Pizzafari cast members. We received a certificate of congratulations for our honeymoon. Upon our initial check in several days before, we were given \"Just Married Buttons\" to wear during our stay. I can't tell you how many cast members offered us congratulations throughout our entire stay. It was an amazing honeymoon and booking the Kilimanjaro club was definitely worth it. We were able to get a quick breakfast or other snacks throughout the day and Disney's attention to detail during our stay was incredible.

We've stayed at other disney deluxe hotels and wanted to try this one to see what it was like. Overall, we had a very nice stay. Keep in mind that what disney calls deluxe, it is not the type of deluxe you might find in 5-star hotels. Disney's deluxe hotels are VERY, VERY nice, but the rooms are not always as plush as some might expect them to be from the prices charged. I think what makes them deluxe is the fact that the hotels have beautiful grounds for viewing and walking though, good facilities and services, extensive recreation options (pools, boating, etc.), close proximity to the disney parks and entertainment areas, and other disney perks. Frankly, when I compare the prices to many of the hotels I've stayed at for business travel, disney hotels are truly worth the price paid - especially if you are able to travel in the off season or are able to take advantage of some other discount offered. What we liked: Hotel grounds, lobby, halls, and room are beautiful. Though dark, the hotel has a very rich feeling and is keeping with the African theme. We actually found it very relaxing. The room was smaller then what we had remembered from other disney deluxe hotels (for example, the contemporary or grand floridian), but since it was just the two of us, we felt we had plenty of room. Our room had a balcony that was overlooking the pool area. The balcony was very nice, felt large and was comfortable. The room was very comfortable as well - even the beds! I did not find hotel noise to be a problem at all. Rooms were quiet, very clean, nice towels and bath ammenities. The shower/toilet area was in a separate room from the vanity. The pool area was fantastic - plenty of shady areas if you need one. There is also one or two whirlpool spas as well. What we didn't like: Since disney was still busy for the holiday season, my mother and I were really looking forward to a drink in the lounge after a day at the park. The hotel lounge could have been nice, but there were a couple of problems. 1) Nobody came to our table to take drink orders, I had to order from the bar. Not a huge problem, but I would expect a deluxe resort to offer the service. 2. There was a family of about 5 kids hanging out at one table. they were noisy, bouncing a ball in the lounge - it escalated into running circles through the lounge/lobby area. Where were the parents??? Where were the disney staff to say something about this??? Very disappointing. Other notes: We had a car and drove to the parks on our own for the first day. However, I'm not yet convinced using your own transportation gets you to where you are going that much faster than the disney transportaion. The second day, we used the disney transportaion to get where we wanted to go. It was more relaxing for me to let someone else do the driving! If I were visiting disney for a week, I would forgo a rental car and just use the disney transportation. I don't think the disney transportation has direct hotel to hotel service either. For example, you cannot take a bus from the Animal Kingdom lodge to the Boardwalk hotel. If you want to go from hotel to hotel, and need to get there fast, consider taking a taxi. Still a lot cheaper than keeping a rental car for a week. If you plan to have a late night snack back at the hotel after an evening at the parks beware - I don't think the AKL has any food service available after 11:30 or 12AM. Check the times of the restaurants or room service (or bar) if you think you want a snack or drink after returning from the parks so that you can plan accordingly. Or consider staying at another disney resort (like the grand floridian)that has 24 hour food service. Also, take advantage of the Disney Photo Pass! I really like this service. At the disney parks, they have photographers available to take your pictures. The service is free. You can view your pictures online, and purchase any that you are interested in (or none at all). Overall, I think this was a really good stay and I would definitely stay at AKL again. I would recommend it for both families as well as for couples.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "JellybabyCheshire", "ReviewID": "UR23561223", "Content": "We spent 7 nights at Animal Kingdom Lodge in January - we are a party of 5 ((2 Ad, 2 Ch (7 + 3), 1 Infant 7mnths)). I am going to start with a very general - we loved the whole experience here. The lodge is very very beautiful, welcoming and felt like 'home'. I will try now to be a little more specific. Many reviews indicate that the Hotel is very dark, it is true that when I first entered the Hotel i thought it was quite dark, but upon having a good look around, it is very much about the theme of the Hotel - 'Africa'. As many have stated the Lobby is stunning - it is also buzzing, has much atmosphere, feels very luxurious whilst also maintaining an air of informality. Bedrooms The Hotel rooms - were beautiful - the furniture very substantial and had little extras that would be expected of Deluxe Resort e.g. Fridge, I-Pod docking station, LCD TV. True the rooms are not huge - but we managed perfectly well as a party of 5 - they are typical of Orlando Hotels - if you are looking for a sitting area perhaps a Disney Villa would be more appropriate. The rooms were spotlessly clean - and all carpets / decoration was very new. Views We had a Savannah room (this was a huge bonus as we had booked a standard room) on Kudu Trail overlooking Ostrich savannah - we had veiews every day of Ostrich & Antelope, and some days of Giraffes & Zebras - we were not disappointed. If I was staying again I would ask for a view overlooking Zebra Trail or Giraffe Trail just primarily because these animals are located there every day. If your budget won't stretch to a Savannah room - no problem, there are so many viewing stations around the resort. They even provide night vision goggles for evening viewing. There is usually a cast member at the viewing points to discuss the animals with you. Pools / Facs Pool area was beautiful, had plenty of loungers, towels, sunshades and had lifeguards on until 9pm - 10pm (i think). The pool was used by all ages until late into the evening and had a real hoilday atmosphere. The Hot tubs were a real bonus too. Hotel has a good fitness centre, Arcade room & also Childcare drop-in centre all which were very well maintained. We felt that this Hotel was family friendly and there were many children staying at the resort with their families. Eating Boma is fantastic - we found that it was suitable for our children. There was always plenty of selections for them to choose from if your children do not eat Adult fare. I would agree the cuisine is African inspired but that adds to the interest. This restaurant is very popular and always busy - so reservations are advised. Mara - Quick Service Restaurant was absolutely fine, we generally only used it for breakfast which was typical cooked breakfast / mickey waffles / Cereals / Bagels / Pastries / Muffins. (It is not a Buffet). Also sold botttles of wine / snacks / at reasonable prices. Jiko - A signature Restaurant - we did not eat in there due to make up of our party. In summary - I have read many of the reviews about AKL and this web is about personal opinion - I have stayed in many 4* + 5* Hotels and found this to be worthy of its rating. We were not disappointed in the least - in fact we would go again.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CourtneyR", "ReviewID": "UR23561855", "Content": "We stayed here just after the hotel opened but visited for the great food the next year!

We had an excellent overall experience. The lobby is outstanding. We wanted a king bed, but when we booked our room in September, we were told they only had a room with a queen and 2 bunk beds. It was fine, and we got lots of extra pillows because of the extra beds. The size of the room was also fine, and the bed was very comfortable. Large towels, and lots of them. The refrigerator came in handy, because we were on the meal plan and there was always too much food for us to finish. We had a savanna room, #3521 on the Zebra Trail, and we constantly saw animals. Giraffes, zebras, gazelles, kudus, elands, cattle, all kinds of birds. The housekeeping was fine...no problems. Also the airline check-in and Magical Express worked pretty much as advertised. Ate at Boma's. LOVED it! Very different flavors, but excellent. The soups, salads and the Zebra Domes for dessert were my favorite. The other reviewers are correct when they say you need reservations. You MUST have reservations for every sit-down restaurant on the property. We were there at a very slow time (never waited for any attraction) and the restaurants were still crowded. The bus system works just fine. Sure, I wish the time between the lodge and the parks was shorter, but it was never that big a deal. Cons: The cable TV was pretty basic. They have HD sets and HD channels, but if you take out the various Disney channels, the sports channels, the news channels and the religious channels, all you have are the networks. The soundproofing is terrible. You can hear the people in the rooms next to you urinating in their bathrooms. Gross! And the frequently unhappy small child in the room next door might as well have been having her tantrums while sitting in our laps, it was so loud. Our bags took over 5 hours to get to our room from the Magical Express. It says 3 hours on their literature. You have to walk right past the smoking area to get to and from the bus stop.

I just wanted to add two small caveats. First, if you went to Disney when you were small and had great memories and think that you can relive those fantasies as an adult with your own child and reluctant husband beware if you decide to do it at this resort. This place is way over priced. If you do not mind spending $300 plus dollars to stay at a Days Inn collocated on a zoo then the AKL is for you. The lobby is truly amazing but that only lasts 1 day before you say...there goes that nice lobby but the room sucks. Maybe I should have had my family sleep in the lobby. The rooms are very very small. Internet is not free. Towels are small. It is like it was built for a little mouse. Hmmmm!!!!!!! Second, they snare you with the savannah room as opposed to the ones facing the parking lot. It\u2019s like a spouse saying \"you do not want to spend two pay checks on a Jlo diamond wedding ring. Are you too cheap for your family\"? Don't fall for it. The savannah view is a BFR (Big Fat Rip Off). You see the same old zoo animals again and again. Why? Because, in order for them to eat they have to parade their happy butts outside your window to pick up the food. They are NOT running around in nature. This is not a wild kingdom voyeur site. It is a zoo!!!!! You will see the same big horned ox shaking his head back and forth. Save up your cash, learn another language and go to Africa. If the motherland is not in your near future, you could instead stay at a hotel closer to the action and do a day trip to the AKL and see the same animals that the $300 guys are seeing but closer. The animals do not come up to your window. There are metal devices that protrude towards the animals so they can not roam freely. Also if you decide to ignore my warning, watch out for the lip of the balcony sliding door in your room. Definite trip hazard. We had to lay a towel down on top of it so my daughter would not crack her skull. I will end on a good note. The bathroom had really cool African wall paper.

We had a rental car and paid for and used the valet service - soooo worth while. $10.00 per day plus tips. The consierge staff were very accomodating - we asked for a can opener and also a cork screw - they were in our room when we returned later in the day. They changed dinner reservations for us. They phoned a restaurant for us to find out what they had going for New Year's Eve and left us a message in our room, as we were on our way out to meet family and couldn't wait. They deleted a tip that I had added to a lunch bill (I didn't know that the tip had already been included). The housekeeping staff left plenty of towels. Every day they gave us shampoo, conditioner and soap. We didn't have a savannah room, but we saw animals everyday from our room. There are viewing areas around the hotel, but we didn't have to go to them as we saw animals daily. I went to the bar 1 evening and requested an empty wine glass, and tom collins glass to take back to our room, not a problem. There didn't seem to be as many small children at this resort. The rest of our family were staying at the Polyenisian Resort. (10 of them). Hubby and I don't have kids, so the travel agent suggested AKL for us. Keep in mind that it is the furthest away from the Magic Kingdom. We ate dinner at Boma the first night. Excellent. African buffet. Would highly recommend it. (My parents have travelled to Africa, they came over to Boma themselves 1 evening and said it was what they remembered from Aftrica. We got breakfast from Mara 1 morning, otherwise we ate our breakfast's elsewhere (just out of convience). The decor of the hotel again was African. Amazing decorations, pictures, the music, carpeting... right down to the bedspreads, and vent covers in the hall ways. The staff dressed in African costume as well. All staff (valet, consierge, housekeepers, and the animal keepers, bartenders etc...) Lovely. All staff were helpful, polite and friendly. Can't say enought about any of the Disney staff. All wonderful. I am going to write a review on Walt Disney Workd itself - as I can't say enough about it. I only have 1 negative thing to say, and it's about the dining time. If you want a relaxed sit down and enjoy meal (1 1/2 to 2 hours in length) you've got to book signature dining that's the 3 $$$'s. Otherwise, it's all about turning the tables and you're in and out in no time. If you're with kids I guess that's expected. I myself would go back to the AKL. But then again there are so many hotels, I might try the Disney Dolphin Hotel. It was beautiful. Hope this review is helpful to those of you planning a disney vacation.

We were extremely excited for the trip as it was our first to Disney in seven years -- and because of the promotional videos and pictures we saw about the Animal Kingdom Lodge. While the hotel is gorgeous, it was not worth the price or the hype. A striking lobby means nothing when you wait in line for 30-45 minutes for a concierge, have a room with two drawers for a family of four, and towels that would barely wrap around a 6-year-old, let alone a normal-sized adult. We found most of the staff to be \"in training.\" I needed tickets that I had pre-purchased for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party, and was directed by Disney to simply visit our hotel concierge, who could print out the tickets for us. The concierge at AKL took 20 minutes with me, continually asking me to be patient as he was trying to figure it out, and I walked away WITHOUT TICKETS. He couldn't figure it out and didn't have anyone to help him. When I went back to get the tickets later, I waited in line for 45 minutes before I found a capable concierge to execute the task. If I'm paying more than $200 a night for a hotel, I'm expecting more than two drawers in my hotel room. Is that crazy? As a result of the scant storage room for clothes in the room, our room was cluttered and messy for the duration of the trip as we lived out of suitcases on suitcase stands in our rooms. The other big issue that I had with AKL was the bus system. While it's awesome that there are dedicated buses for AKL that preclude you from stopping at other hotels for pickup, the buses came every 15-20 minutes, and there was no system for bus boarding. While I appreciate Disney betting that the everyday human will be in good spirits on his/her vacation and therefore not have the nerve to board a bus before a load of people who waited the entire 15-minute duration, they underestimate the gall of many, many a guest. I cannot tell you how many times we'd get to the bus stop and be the first to wait for a bus, only to watch someone stroll up right as the bus arrived and right in front of us as we loaded our small children. Disney is asking for Tyson-like fights to erupt with this \"every Mouse for himself\" system. Everyone channels their inner Grumpy as they board (and often, stand on a moving bus for the 15 minute ride to the parks). AKL is an investment. And when you make an investment in a nice hotel, you expect a return. AKL was a losing investment for us. Check out Port Orleans, Key West, Saratoga or any of the economy resorts. There ALWAYS seemed to be buses for them waiting outside the parks!

We had actually booked 2 rooms for 6 adults the the Caribbean Beach resort, but they had overbooked the Value resorts so we got bumped to the Animal Kingdom lodge, while the other Value guests were bumped to the Caribbean Resort. Not only that but when we checked in we weren't exactly ecstatic about the view of the parking lot so they bumped us up to a Savannah View room on Kudu Trail. It was quite the hike to our room, but really is absolutely NO different than staying at any of the Deluxe Resorts. At least at this resort you are attached inside. Also, our room faced the construction that is going on where they are building the Villas, and honestly IT DID NOT BOTHER US AT ALL. And it certainly did not bother the animals, there was always a giraffe or Zebra hanging out right in front of the balcony. People complaining that the rooms and resort are dark may not be aware that this is actually done on purpose for the animals for their benefit and ours! It also so we can see the nocturnal animals who come out night. The resort also has night vision so you can see them around the resort! After hearing complaints about the bus service here, I didn't find that we waited longer than at any other resort. The most we waited was 20 minutes and this was near the end of the night when they weren't running as frequently. The housekeeping was the only small complaint. And I mean small. It wasn't as thorough as at the Polynesian, but the beds were made and everything was replenished. Mara, the quick service restaurant was wonderful for a quick bite with Burgers, Chicken Tenders, Wraps, Sandwiches, Roast Chicken and African Stew. We used the Dining Plan which I strongly recommend, it is a great deal and saves the hassle of worrying about food all the time. The staff is really friendly! The lady who works at the bar near the pool is awesome, she remembered all our names every day. It was just that little extra Disney attitude that really makes the trip amazing. I witnessed some picky and rude customers complaining to the concierge one morning and I can't believe how well they handled them, honestly I would not have been so pleasant... Advice: ~ Request any of the rooms on Giraffe or Kudu Trail, each side faces a Savannah. We looked the opposite direction of the main inner Savannah and had more animals than the main one almost all of the time ~We found that it wasn't really necessary to reserve breakfast at Boma as long as you were there before 8:00. The buffet at breakfast is amazing. ~EAT AT JIKO. We ate at Narcoosees, California Grill, Ohana's and The Brown Derby and this restaurant had the best atmosphere and menu. Not to mention our server was above and beyond with the wine list knowledge. This will most likely require reservations in advance. ~We recommend making your room requests when you book your trip but then call again a few days before you arrive. They will usually know when you are gonna be and then they can perhaps make adjustments before you get there. ~Just ask. They will go out of their way to assist you. We were a forgetful bunch and lost jewelry, a wallet, Key card and sunglasses and all were either returned to us or are being shipped home free of charge.

The most wonderful experience was when we came back to our room to get ready for dinner, there was a giraffe laying directly in front of our room. It was the first thing we saw when we opened the door to our room.

I was nervous after reading these reviews but wanted to share with you my experience. STAFF - the staff was much nicer to us than these reviews let on. We were checked in by Carlos after arriving early (12:30pm) and he not only got us into a room right away, but he had upgraded us to a Sunset Savannah room (one of the 3280s). We had gotten an amazing rate as a Disney Passholder (159 per night). The room was GREAT (not small like everyone states on here). We had an amazing view of giraffes, zebra, antelope, ostrich, and other animals on the \"Sunset Savannah\". There was construction going on across the way but it didn't bother us. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants...Jiko was too pricey and Boma had disappointed me once previously. We did eat at the counter service MARA and that was fine. Pool and whirlpools were amazing, as were the \"night vision\" goggles to watch to animals at night! One thing the reviews have pegged right, the Disney Bus transportation was AWFUL. This lodge is very far out and it often seemed like we were the lone waiters as scores of buses for the cheaper hotels passed by us. One driver even got lost on our way home from Magic Kingdom, and we were halfway up 192 at 11pm at night before he realized it. I definitely would NOT recommend staying here WITHOUT renting a car. Otherwise it was great...lobby was beautiful with Christmas decorations. I do wish they had food options available after midnight. Overall: It was better than I expected but I am not sure I would stay here again. It's priced as a deluxe hotel but really doesn't pull off the right level service to deserve that category.
